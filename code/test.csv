"I'm a big proponent for LG televisions because of personal experience. I've purchased three LG televisions and have loved the picture quality and ease of use with each one. I purchased this 32 inch LG television in 2010 as my primary bedroom TV set. I love the picture quality, price and reliability. It's going on 4 years plus and looks brand new. Obviously, today's televisions don't have the best sound quality, and I always use external speakers for sound anyway. So any negatives on a TV's sound quality has no effect on me. Love ordering this television and finding it on my front porch the next day. Great purchase.","04 24, 2014",LG Television for the bedroom.,1398297600,Electronics
"Rock 'n Roll lost a true guitar legend when Alvin Lee passed away.Alvin was amazingly fast, creative, fluent in many different musical styles, and could rip the roof off the joint when he was on stage.If you were a fan of Ten Years After, this CD compilation is a great way to refresh your musical memories.This is a great collection of some of their best songs, and also showcases the different rock & blues rock styles that Alvin & the boys were capable of.Many of these tracks have the feel of a great live band, which is truly what Ten Years After was all about......playing it LIVE!If you are not familiar with Alvin Lee and Ten Years After, then you really owe it to yourself to widen your musical horizons and immerse your senses in these great songs and great guitar solos.TURN IT UP and rock with a legendary band!","08 21, 2013",Alvin Lee......a true guitar legend,1377043200,CDVinyl
"I know I might stir the pot with this review. However, I own three different versions of this movie so I do have basis of comparison. The Brentwood version was the best I owned picture wise on DVD. While not the best it was watchable compared to Digiview version I owned as well, which was pretty unwatchable. So after of all negative reviews I have read I was all set to send my Blu-Ray copy back that I had originally pre-ordered with excitement since I love this movie as much as you guys. I decided to look at the Blu-Ray myself just before sending it back. So here is my review of the One Eyed Jacks Blu-Ray and I will try to be objective and fair. First, I put the Blu-Ray in my Samsung player and I had the issues everyone else had trying to get past the copyright warning screen. Once I figured out that pressing the pop up menu button would bring up the main menu everything was ok. I had to change the language to English since the default was German, which was pretty easy to do. The opening credits were in German which might bother some, but it didn't really bother me.  Now the part everyone cares about the picture and audio quality. If you were comparing this to a transfer of The Searchers well of course The Searchers would win hands down in comparison. I used The Searchers as an example since both are Vista Vision prints. The Searchers has had major restoration work done so of course it's going to look better. However, compared to other versions of One Eyed Jacks I own on DVD this Blu-Ray is by far the best version available. It looks pretty decent on my Samsung 52in 120hz HDTV is it the version we all want? No, but it's by far the best version out there IMHO until Paramount or a major studio undertakes the needed restoration for this film. The colors could be better but a small color adjustment on my T.V. helped quite a bit. Overall, and like I said before I am fairly happy with this Blu-Ray of One Eyed Jacks and consider it a decent upgrade until a studio like Paramount spends the money to restore the original negative. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps someone who is on the fence and not sure of which way to go.  Bob","11 15, 2011",One Eyed Jacks Blu-Ray Review,1321315200,MovieTV

"Bought these to save some money on batteries. Like everyone else on Amazon I thought I could save some money on batteries by buying rechargeables. The problem is that rechargeable batteries themselves do not last a long time. They have a limited life span of about two years, whether they are charged or not is irrelevant. The chip inside the batteries or the chemicals they used to make them breaks down. So when you go to charge them your charger will tell you that the battery is defective and you have to buy a new rechargeable battery. It is probably cheaper to buy regular alkaline batteries.","12 1, 2012",Can't Charge Me,1354320000,Electronics

"I have seen Holmes in many guises, most of which are far from the discerning detective that Doyle described.  Very few really have the aura and presence you would expect of the real Sherlock Holmes.  This film (along with the episodes of the late, great Jeramy Brett) comes as close to being that man as any I have seen.  Holmes, who undertakes only investigations he deems worthy of his skills and time, is more than adequately portrayed by Christopher Plummer.  And what adversary better to try the great detective's skills than Jack the Ripper. So, wait for a rainy or foggy night, turn the lights low and travel to a time and place that only Sherlock would dare to go, and wait for the goose bumps.","08 3, 2013",Holmes as Doyle would know him,1375488000,MovieTV
"I love everything about this camera except one really annoying issue that almost caused me to return it.  The slanted dial on the top moves very easily.  Almost impossible to take in and out of a pocket and not have that dial move.  Many good pictures have been lost because the dial too easily moved to another setting.  Otherwise the camera is great.  I like the fact that I control when the flash pops up.  It's quick and the pictures are sharp if lighting is fairly normal.  Abnormal lighting like shooting in trees isn't so great, but that would be tricky for a lot of cameras.","09 10, 2012",Great but one really annoying issue,1347235200,Electronics

"I could list a whole string of adjectives, but I don't have even an interest in doing that. Just the bottom line: ""Bridesmaids"" is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.Nothing aroused pity or awe. Nothing was redeeming. There was nothing to celebrate. Absolutely nothing made me smile, not even inside and this is supposed to be the Comedy of the Summer. All I can think of is the bride-to-be squatting in the street in her soon-to-be wedding gown and having a diarrheric outburst after eating spoiled food. It was not a funny moment. Or picturing that awful woman slinging her leg on the door post while the air marshall was trying to get to his seat. Or that awful Kristen Wiig destroying the bridal shower decorations and food because she was jealous.The whole movie had the feel of Saturday Night Live to it, not the various old Nights, but the current one that is vulgar and foul beyond belief, lead especially by one of the most obnoxious ""comedians"" to ever hold sway over the show. I'm sure Phil Hartman is rolling in his grave.The poor Irish actor, who was stuck as Kristen's love interest--I mean, how did he get in there?That's all I care to say about this pitiful movie.","10 4, 2011",Absolutely the worst movie!,1317686400,MovieTV
"Yuck frontman Daniel Blumberg made a curious decision earlier this year. After roughing it out with various projects, he had finally achieved his biggest breakthrough to date with his band's self titled debut in 2011. At the seeming height of his success, Blumberg walked away to focus on a project called Hebronix, leaving bandmates Max Bloom, Mariko Doi, and Jonny Rogoff scrambling for a new direction. The good news about the band's sophomore album, Glow and Behold, is that it is recognizably Yuck. They haven't transformed into an entirely different band, as some naysayers prognosticated around the time of Blumberg's departure.To the contrary, the band now presents a more mature sounding record that is no longer as beholden to their influences as they were on their debut. Nor are they buried under a wall of distortion like they were before. And while their first album sounded like a starry-eyed teenager's 90s pop bedroom fantasy, the Yuck of Glow and Behold sound much more grown up and musically adventurous. Their change in perspective becomes immediately obvious on ""Out of Time,"" a breezy, self assured indie rock tune with crisp guitar and a smooth, serene vocal performance from Bloom. Doi, now serving as the band's primary backing vocalist, delivers a gorgeous vocal aria to close it out. Bloom, for his part, does an commendable job taking over the frontman's role. Whether you prefer Bloom or Blumberg in terms of vocal capability will come down to personal opinion, but the two are cut from the same cloth. Neither are particularly flashy or showy -- just solid, quality singers.The change in direction is more obvious in other areas, however. Whereas Yuck was an album bolstered by strong hooks and catchy melodies, the followup is more concerned with the background texture and coloring of the songs. ""Lose My Breath"" and ""Middle Sea"" may be reminiscent of their older material, but ""Rebirth"" draws inspiration from a different corner of the 90s. With its haze filled and hypnotic chord pattern, it sounds like a My Bloody Valentine song, thus showing they can be true to their 90s roots while doing it in different ways. In other places, the experimentation is more subtle. ""How Does It Feel"" offers some new touches by delivering spacey slide guitar, along with a Neutral Milk Hotel style horn section in the beginning.There are a few softer ballads along the way, some more successful than others. ""Nothing New"" is the most emotionally raw and honest piece on the entire album, while others like ""Somewhere"" do an admirable job but don't live up high bar set by previous pieces like ""Suicide Policeman"" and ""Sunday."" And of course, the title track and album closer is another bonafide piece of great indie pop/rock. Yet despite all of the positive developments, Blumberg's absence is still roundly felt. His skills as a guitarist and songwriter cannot be understated. The melodic guitar leads that were a highlight in previous songs like ""Get Away"" and ""Shook Down"" are heard much less often on Glow and Behold.Although songs like ""Glow and Behold"" and ""Out of Time"" certainly offer up catchy indie pop, the rugged Dinosaur Jr. inspired cuts from Blumberg boasted much stronger melodies, were tighter, and more anthemic. They tended to stay with you longer due to the simplicity of their delivery and the exuberant celebration of youth that he infused into those songs. Those type of intangibles are difficult to replace, and alas Yuck sounds much less likely to let their hair down here. Therefore, it's a difficult case to make that they're better off without Blumberg; for that matter, it's hard to argue that this record is better than the first. Fair or not, it seems it's Glow and Behold's fate to be compared to their Blumberg era material. But if you're willing to look beyond that you'll find Yuck is still a vibrant and creative force laying down their new identity, and seem to have the opportunity to move in directions even Blumberg couldn't take them.","09 30, 2013",Indie rockers Yuck boldly emerge with new ideas and new frontman,1380499200,CDVinyl

"I first saw Ryan Adams in the 1990s with Whiskeytown, and he is one of the few who lives up to his potential. Liked that band a lot, but didn't love Ryan Adams until Heartbreaker. Lost interest somewhere along the way -- not with the music, really, but with the constant new records I couldn't keep up with. And then I started missing him. Where's Ryan Adams? Gold sounded like an album that *wanted* to be a classic. This one just is, and it's beautiful.

"After giving up on the last few, I bought the DVD set and it is still packaged in the accordian format that scratches the discs everytime they are removed.  All four DVDs came heavily scratched new.  The discs are made at Cinram's DVD facility in Olyphant,PA.  I called Fox and they told me to return the discs to the store.  All the sets were like this at the store.  I ended up with the Blu-Ray set which comes in a proper plastic case that actually protects.Bunch of hypocrites at Fox for this so-called eco packaging that can't be recycled (laminated gloss paperboard), isn't durable, and doesn't protect the discs.

"This package contains 4 rolls of Velcro ties. What makes them different from velcro that you can buy at any sewing store (for less money) is the shape they are cut into. I am attaching a photo which shows the shape that allows you thread one end into the other for tightening. Each ties is 1/4 inch wide and 7 1/2 inches long. However they are not separated in the roll, so you can detach two ties as a unit, making a whole unit 15 inches long (and so forth in units of 7 1/2 inches).The benefit of Velcro ties over plastic ties is that they can be reused. They are easy to adjust in size by wrapping them a few extra times or loosening.I found many uses for these ties. From obvious ones to somewhat creative:- keeping my computer cords tidy and untangled- attaching outdoor art to the black iron rod railing- keeping wrapping paper from unrolling- for bundling ski poles, garden sticks, and other long objects in the basement for storage- keeping glasses attached the visor in the car- keeping my phone inside a pouch without slipping out (yet either to remove when needed)- securing a cargo net in the back of my car- attaching a loop that holds the cable to recharge my tablet at table level while plugged in (otherwise it was on the floor when not in use)- several loops that are attached to my textile loom, which holds shuttles and scissors when they are not use, but right there when I need them- used as tarp fastener to keep the tarp over objects under my deck while construction on the deck was going onGood stuff - I recommend!Ali Julia review","07 14, 2012",Very nice!

"Although it didn't sell much when released in 1977, Let There Be Rock is the first of several classic albums from AC/DC. This is raw, dirty, sweaty, no nonsense rock n' roll performed with vigor and zeal. This is also one of the few discs in that the first two songs are the least memorable ones on the album. And that's not to say that ""Go Down"" and ""Dog Eat Dog"" aren't great because they are. However, the album's strong rep comes on the next track. Featuring a blistering riff from Malcolm Young, a great story lyric from Bon Scott, and wicked guitar solos from Angus Young, the title song is one of the all-time great anthems. Not to be outdone is the ode to big women called ""Whole Lotta Rosie"", another enduring track with a memorable riff that the band still plays live. ""Problem Child"" is another great anthem while ""Overdose"" is a slow burner that may have been the closest the band ever came to a ballad. ""Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be"" and ""Bad Boy Boogie"" are two more great tracks with riffs galore that still appear in their live shows. Certainly one of their best five albums (I have it at #3 behind Back in Black and Highway to Hell), Let There Be Rock is a must own for any fan of great `70s hard rock.","10 16, 2011",A must own if you love hard rock music,1318723200,CDVinyl

"I have shot and processed my first roll (in square mode) and am in the middle of shooting a roll in half-frame mode.  This review treats my initial observations but can say nothing about long-term performance.The first thing, which I wish somebody had said in a review but nobody did:  In the product description when they say 36 shots ""per roll"" they mean a 36-exposure roll.  If you shoot on a 24 exposure roll, you will get 24 shots (or 48-50 in half frame mode).  The 24mm square negatives are spaced 11mm apart so they take up the same amount of film as a regular 35mm frame.  This was done to facilitate automatic film processing, which is not designed to handle exotic frame sizes.  In theory, since the shutter is not directly linked to the film wind mechanism, you could measure the takeup spindle and figure out exactly how far to twist the knob to advance the film 24mm - thus placing your frames right next to each other and getting approximately 30% more shots per roll.  But this would be a huge hassle when shooting, and would be a disaster for processing unless you develop your own film.  The compromise design wastes a lot of film in square mode, but it is the only workable solution.The lens is very short - only a 24mm focal length, which gives a very wide field of view, possibly making up for the smaller frame.  The range focus indicator is hard to see (and I have an uneasy feeling that it doesn't really do anything.)  Poor-quality optics and abundant light leaks are part of the Lomography experience, and in that regard the Mini is actually LESS crappy than I expected.  I shoot mainly in black & white, and the pictures look pretty good from my test roll.  The cable release socket is in just the right place, and this camera is a whiz at doing long exposures.I did get a hoot out of seeing the top of the lens sticking up prominently in the viewfinder.  You'll do almost as well not using the viewfinder at all, but just pointing the camera towards what you want to photograph, and snapping away.The shutter is very stiff, and it releases with a jarring ""CLUNK"" that tends to jostle the camera unless you brace it very firmly against your head or your chest.  Motion blur seems inevitable.  If the camera was heavier, this would not be a problem (as its own inertia would dampen sudden jars) but the Mini is feather-light and easy to shake.  It's possible though, that the short lens helps to compensate for this.  None of my test shots had any camera-jiggle blur.The strap is wispy, but substantial enough to carry this camera without worry.  The Mini is small enough to sit in the palm of your hand, but it is too lumpy to really fit in a pocket.At first I thought the price was too high, but the build quality is better than I expected .. and it comes in a BEAUTIFUL box with a kitschy little photo-art book.  Honestly, they could simplify the packaging and cut the price in half, but for what you get I think $50 is actually pretty fair.The best thing about this camera is, it's just fun to use.  There's no laborious thinking about exposures and focusing and framing.  With 50 shots per roll I can snap away like a madman, and odds are that just as many of my pictures will turn out interesting as they would if I shot more deliberately with one of my ""serious"" cameras.","08 2, 2013",It's kind of cool,1375401600,Electronics

"This great motherboard is now sitting within aNZXT Phantom 410 Mid Tower USB 3.0 Gaming Case - Whiteand is looking brilliant.  The capabilites of this board are fantastic: PCI-E 3.0, USB 3.0, native Ivy Bridge support, with a lot of utilities to go along with it.  The Bios alone is awe-inspiring with how much control you have over every aspect of each component down to how much power you want to send down to .01V.This really is a fantastically built component, aesthetically it looks great in a case.  The installation is rather tedious because the screws must go into rather deep holes within the Thermal Armor, which makes it a balancing act if your screwdriver happens to not be magnetized, but I wouldn't deduct a star or anything for this inconvenience.The only real downside comes from the 8-pin connector which is diagonal to the 24-pin power connector and is also on the top left, so you must have wires everywhere.The Thermal Armor works great though, you can install two 40MM fans that are included to the motherboard to increase airflow and what's really nice is when you turn off your rig it defaults to leaving these fans on for one minute to cool off your system faster for increased component longevity.It's the Sabertooth, it has a 5 year warranty, military-grade components, and it also has surprisingly vibrant audio!  I was actually taken back by how well this board throws out music, videos, and games.  I know on the RoG lines Asus always adds extra power and islolates the audio driver on the board, and this technology has certainly carried over!  What you get is audio that is crisp, clean, and powerful when that 'nade explodes beside you!Overall, I would get this board again and again, it is extremely high quality, looks fantastic in a case, offers great cooling, and has all the latest capabilities.Thanks for reading, and hope this review helped!","05 21, 2012",Brilliant Backbone For A Beast!,1337558400,Electronics

"This holder is made of sturdy plastic and has a swivel neck that can be tightened via flat-head screw in your preferred position and it stays there.The wing nut that tightens the device in the CD slot works quickly, but it may hit your decks protruding knobs as it does with mine. I removed it and replaced it with a flat-head screw with the same length and thread (Similar to the screw that locks the swivel neck in place).  The arm holders adjust to many positions with rubber cushions on the sides easily holding most current devices. One problem is that it doesn't hold devices in thick cases. My Otterbox Commuter case with the wallet compartment was too thick.I also like the fact that it has an opening at the bottom allowing my USB plug if needed. The only concern is that if you're using the attached support device at the bottom, it's short and very close to the holder arms which means your large phone is held at the bottom instead of center making it top-heavy and it could tip out. You can remove the support, but your device could drop through if you don't have it tight enough and I'd recommend against over-tightening the arms. It is after all, only plastic. If they made a lower/longer bottom support attachment, that would solve this problem. Overall, not a bad holder.

To my surprise I saw the KMC-3 made by Klipsch. A brand I know very well, but not aware they had recently jumped into the wireless speaker market too. The KMC-3 looks as big as it sounds. It was easily the biggest unit there, but not so big that it hampers its portability. It's dead simple to pair a device. You hold down the blue infinity symbol until it flashes, and wait for your phone to discover it. Done. I put on a mix of tunes and cranked the volume. The KMC-3 easily stood out amongst the ambient noise in the store. No small feat for a portable speaker in such a large space. The KMC-3 will have no problem rocking a patio, tailgate, or beach party. However, it was the low end punch that immediately caught my attention. The bass is deeper and more refined than any similar unit I've heard before. Unlike Bose which tends to be over saturated and muddy. This is legendary Klipsch sound. The high's are accurate and detailed. Again, this is Klipsch. The midrange can be dark at times because of the extensive bass and precise treble, but I never felt that vocal heavy tracks suffered. They still sounded warm and were quite enjoyable. Overall, the KMC-3 sounds very good for its size. People might be thrown off for the 8 D cells required to power it remotely, but I see this unit as a home bound model first given its size/power/price, and a portable speaker second, so not really a flaw. Think of it as a bonus. If you're looking for something more portable I would check out the KMC-1, which is also excellent, but for $400 the KMC-3 offers what I believe to be the best sound in its category.

"After non-stop factory resets and horrible customer support, I ditched my Co-Star for a Sony NSZ-GS7 and I can't believe I stuck with the Co-Star for so long. The Sony unit was easier to set-up and has worked flawlessly. Also, the Sony remote blows doors off the brick of a remote that Vizio created for Co-Star. The usability of the whole interface is better. My wife wouldn't touch the Co-Star, but she is comfortable using the Sony unit. Overall, the Sony NSZ is the consumer-ready Google TV device I have been seeking instead of the barely even beta tester worthy Co-Star unit.","03 21, 2013","Buy Sony, Not Co-Star",1363824000,Electronics

"I originally purchased the rental of &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; (starring Tom Cruise) on April 11, 2014 to complement my purchases of two other movies starring Tom Cruise (Top Gun and Jerry Maguire).  Tom Cruise stars as a former military veteran named Brian Flanagan who is determined to transition into a successful and prosperous man on a professional scale. Things do not initially go as planned in his job search and educational efforts. He bounces back through trying his hand at employment in a bar after initially making an impression on Dough Coughlin (played by Bryan Brown).  Flanagan and Coughlin team up together in the bar and impress some of the most influential people in New York.  What sets the tone for the movie is that Flanagan is serious about eventually opening his own business and encourages Coughlin to partner up with him. Obviously, I must avoid saying more to keep in mind those who have not seen the film. However,what also shapes Flanagan&#8217;s journey is when he unexpectedly falls in love with a woman who feels the same way about him.","05 14, 2014",Business Owner Tom Cruise,1400025600,MovieTV

You will not be disappointed. I waited for a long time for this play to become available again. So get yours soon.This play was very good and unbelievable, meaning there was so much reality in this play that this play will have you not knowing which way things will turn out. So many twist and turns.. New faces, scripture, God all through this play!Love first lady, and grandmother (mother Laster) was so real! We need the elders! What happen to the people that would step in when a marriage or soul was in trouble... You don't see much of this now days.You will be on the edge of your seat because there are so many unexpected things in this play.. Many many elements of surprise through out this play! You will also laugh as well as be inspired.I would love the sound track from this play as well.Just because you have unequally yoked relationships does not mean things can not be saved. This is a great lesson on unequally yoked relationships. And just because relationships look dead, does not mean you can not speak life to the dry bones!DVD came sealed and was not broken. Quality of the screen was good.This play shows strongholds, deliverance, mindsets, and the tricks of the enemy and how he plays with your mind.Don't let the bad reviews fool you. This play does not have as many modern settings like the current plays we see. However when you go back and look at the old plays they still have a blessed message and this play has a message that will bless you. Seek the message and don't let the enemy trick you into not watching this play.This play was on point and to the point. This is a much needed play in our current times of the status of marriages in all cultures, but especially in the African American culture.. you can and will learn a whole lot from this play, don't judge a play by its cover or stage settings.Each relationship in this play goes through challenges that are reality. This shows the solutions to those issues as well. The characters are great and do an excellent job. I want to see more plays like this on the same subject matter with the solutions because this is needed to save the marriages and relationships of today.. Too many give up and too many stand for nothing.The play is so deep and needs to be seen by couples who are thinking about marriage and ones who are married. This has great music.We are already watching this for a second time and will continue to watch this over and over again. This is clean truth that family and friends can watch together.. Start a save marriage and relationships campaign in your community.We all change, but we should not let those changes tear our marriages apart. Remember as the play shows prayer still works!Please make more plays like this.. They are needed. This should be required for all couples before and after marriage..., We invest in everything in this world, but where is our faith, and why don't we invest in marriage and our relationships? We believe in everything this world shows us, but do not believe in marriage or healthy relationships.Keep praying for all marriages and relationships to be restored to better than what they were.. The divorce rate in the African American community is too high. Lets change this.. we can do it if we try and stand for something..Buy one for yourself and buy more as gifts! From a married mother of more than four children.. stay prayed up, the enemy is always on his job, look at the attack on marriages and relationships at the start of 2013 and end of 2012.Thanks for making this play available!

"Comedies stand the test of time better than any other genre, and what comedy was more daring and ascebically funny than Preston Sturges' ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek?"" It showcases the best career performances of all three of its stars,  Eddie Bracken, Betty Hutton, and William Demerast, plus the great Sturges stock company of character comedians including such familiar faces, although not familiar names, as Frank Moran, Harry Rosenthal, Al Bridge, Torben Mayer, the ubiquitous Jimmy Conlin and a special appearance by McGinty and the Boss (Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff reprising their roles from Sturges' ""The Great McGinty"".) ""Going My Way,"" also released the same year and winner of the Best Picture Oscar, is a fine film. but sometimes its mawkish sentimentality gets in the way of the comic chemistry of Barry Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby. Sturges' 1944 masterpiece remains a decidedly unsentimental and hilariously cynical take on the human condition.","03 22, 2014",The best movie from the year I was born,1395446400,MovieTV

"WARNING: The review you are about to read will give Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare a great deal of praise. However this film should not be construed as good, interesting, or scary in any sense imaginable. So if you are seeking a legitimate horror movie then turn around and run screaming 'he's gone, the evils gone from here!"" as this will not be your cup of tea. Now that we have been clear on this matter let us just say that Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare was a stroke of B genius. It's almost as if the song Shout at the Devil was transposed into a film. Except it would be like a really horrific cover band's version with Vince Niel's brother Vance Niel at the helm. The level of confusion was elevated to new heights that only the likes ofWicked Gamescould possible comprehend. The only difference was a whole lot more mullets, horrible 80's rock, and a lead singer that looked like a David Lee Roth impersonator. Oh and we can't forget the hand puppets...yeah there were actual hand puppets.Rock 'n' Roll nightmare wastes no time in the confusion department, being that within a couple minutes you have no idea what is going on. Apparently a family gets killed in an old farmhouse by something evil and a skeleton head comes screaming out of the oven. After that the camera follows a van driving on the road for a straight ten minutes. God forbid you're watching this high because you'd fully be freaking out at this point. Once the van finally arrives at this old farmhouse our band of misfits come stumbling out to deliver one of the most awkward scenes in movie history. Every actor butchered their lines stuttering and all. The drummer was our favorite. This guys had the WORST Australian accent that he would drift in and out of throughout the entire film. So turns out they're at this farmhouse to record some new tunes and fall prey to a punch of hand puppets from the darkside. The puppets somehow kill them one by one, take the murdered humans form, and strut around the house as if nothing happened. In the end turns out the lead singer is actually an angel that tricked the devil to show up at this farmhouse and....uh forget it. It's honestly too confusing too attempt to explain.Rock 'n' Roll nightmare may offer nothing to the conventional movie watcher, but delivers an inordinate amount of laughs for the B lover. It is honestly one of the worst film's that has ever been created in the best way possible. It's worth the watch just to see this super fruity 80's band led by the David Lee Roth impersonator with his leopard blazer. Watching them record music in the studio was something every person should witness at least once in their lives.  The onscreen chemistry between this band was obviously something the world was lucky to have caught on film. The devil may have been the highlight of the evening. This thing couldn't have taken more then 15 minutes to whip up and looks exactly like creature on the cover. Really something MST3K should have done years ago. We implore you to get in touch with your inner mullet this Halloween and cue up a film that makes 80's hair metal look even worse.","10 4, 2011",For those about to Rock!

"This film is essential an acting vehicle for the two leads, Michelle Williams and Ryan Gostling as Cindy and Dean respectively.  They are in one hell of a train wreck marriage.  The movie takes the now familiar path of using flashbacks throughout the movie to give us a sense of how the characters got to where they are now.  It's very effective and for once, easy to follow.  Both actors give Oscar-worthy performances in this believable story of love and its destruction.  The director uses a minimalist approach both in sets and acting ensemble.  The movie is difficult to watch; we see they still love each other, but are certainly no longer ""in"" love.  For another film with a similar theme check out ""Two for the Road"" (1967).

"Update 1/11/2014:  I just want to add a tip that someone gave me in a comment to another Note 10.1 2014 review. In the review that follows, I complain that Android is not really conducive to developing and editing spreadsheets, That's true ( .for me at least), but the tip was to work spreadsheets with the tablet in portrait position rather than landscape. That really does help.Update 12/3/2013:  First of all, I've downgraded my rating to 4 stars -- for the same reasons many have commented on.  I just don't find the problems to be as large or as tedious of some do and I get a lot more benefits from my Note 10.1 than I have issues, so I would really say a 4+.The biggest issue is that the Note hand writing translation is not anywhere near perfect and does actually have a few naughty problems that will at times slow you down.  I find you need to learn how to ""write"" on the note.  For example, it has difficulty between my ""i"", ""l"", ""/"", and even ""'"" or "","".  As I get more meticulous the better the result.  My ""tt"" is done with three strokes, not four.  The Note seems to have learned how to handle that.  (Good!)  Stray spaces or overwrites tend to happen and mostly surprise me and require correction.  But at times the Note just correctly interprets the same input.  (Strange!)So for me who uses the Note to communicate with others (not just to take notes for myself) and who tends to perfectionism on spelling and punctuation, there IS a certain amount of frustration and correction that I shouldn't have to do.  (I should point out that 45 years ago in college, I learned to print FAST because I couldn't read my own writing when it came time to review/study.  I haven't tested Note with my writing, but frankly, I shudder.)So why a 4-star review?  I love it.  With some minimal correcting, I generally get what I want properly entered with the s-pen and I feel no need for a real keyboard despite being an excellent typist.  I MUCH prefer the s-pen over poking the screen keyboard.  Those who complain about lag, even with TouchWiz, clearly are not getting all the Samsung updates or may have other issues.  (Incidently, as a new Samsung user, I LIKE TouchWiz and have not felt a need to replace it.  I also just got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 and naturally there is almost no learning curve.)  Despite TouchWiz, Android 4.3 is simple Android 4.3.  Don't bother me with complaints otherwise.The screen is great, the size is perfect for me (where the Nexus 7 was just too small), the feel is good and after 3 weeks I still don't understand why people complain so vehemently about accidentally pressing fixed button or soft keys.  Some adaptability in life is a good thing.  I won't say that accidental key presses have not happened, but no more than using my 6 year old laptop (still getting occasional use).The speakers puke, but that's why I bought a Logitech Bluetooth Speaker for my Nexus 7.  I use my devices for music access, not for quality sound.  You need to find your own sound quality.  A photographer or a smartphone owner may not want to use the onboard camera, but it is definitely useful at times with reasonable results.My other use for a Note is for woodworking design.  The is no replacement for Sketchup -- that's the only software for which I need to find an Adroid option.  However, some limited use of the S-note and Sketchpad have been very promising and hand drawings are basically how I start everything and sometimes the only thing I use.I'm a retired programmer/project manager and now have only an irregular need for a full computer system though I have been dependent on a PC and then a laptop for more than 30 years until 3 weeks ago.  My laptop still suffices when needed, but I've hardly used it at all since getting the Note.  My biggest issue is with the extensive spreadsheets that I would like to be able to use, edit and update on the Note.  Spreadsheets in general are not well supported by the Note software (or any other Android software that I have found). Spreadsheets are not pure text input and Samsung or someone else should provide a ""Cell Based"" input means that doesn't cover half the visible spreadsheet with an input area.  So there is some spreadsheet utility, but at this point, I still must go to the laptop for major updates.I don't see that as particularly a Samsung problem although they could (and should) certainly provide the solution.  The Android spreadsheet software is just lacking for advanced work.  Most of the FUNCTION is there, but as I said, the interface is weak.  This typically would only affect me about 3 - 4 times a year.  My spreadsheets have 10 years of development and use in them for budget management.  I can still see my results (including the graphical analysis) and do limited inputs with what is available on Android.So this spreadsheet limitation is the ONE item that prevents ME from COMPLETELY replacing a Windows based computer with the Note 10.1.  It may not work for others, others may feel more limited, it may be necessary to adapt to new software and techniques (cloud usage) but I am very satisfied with the Note.  Improved S-pen software and a good spreadsheet interface, would complete my requirements.I've never been an Apple user though in my technical days did involve early Macs.  I'm in the camp that the the iPad bigots should ""get over it"".  If you like your device, fine.  It's not better than mine for my purposes -- I like to be able to manage my own device.(It suddenly strikes me to say that MY usage has almost NOTHING to do with media entertainment.  Interesting!)(Begin original thoughts:)It's hard to add any to the good reviews that have already been made, so mostly I'll first recommend that you read the first 5 - 8 reviews under the default ""Most Helpful First"" sort.  At the end of this preliminary review, I'll add the many suggestions I collected from reading ALL the reviews and comments -- that should help some of you who are new or still trying to learn.  And I strongly recommend that anyone watch the 48 minute YouTube review that I have posted as a comment.  There is more good information and orientation in that video than you'll find in maybe any other.Despite some dissenters on this idea, I'm using the Note 10.1 as a replacement for my venerable Win7 on Sony VAIO laptop.  The laptop is beginning to show it's age and wear after 6 years.  Still runs better than my wife's new Lenovo Twist with Win8.  I've been using a Nexus 7 for the past year and this Note is much nicer.So related to this laptop replacement, one question I have up front is whether any of those who rate this tablet at 5 or 4 either have or plan to get a bluetooth keyboard to use with it.  At this point, I'm not in a rush, but as a typist, a keyboard CAN be nice.  For me, the keyboard would stay in my living room like my laptop does -- I definitely will use the Note and stylus for portability and convenience. (Edit:  You can get a keyboard, but I now don't think it is necessary.)The most difficult concern with this tablet is it's complexity (I've commented about this in a number of other reviews).  After that concern, there is a nice ""feature"" that got in the way -- once you follow the introductory setup, if you already have had a tablet, the Note will go out to Google and/or Samsung and start downloading your configuration and apps.  Nice (it took several hours to get all mine from my Nexus 7) but interferes with getting the new updates from Samsung.As others said, there are currently three updates which eliminate the lag and add multi-tasking.  If your new Note is clean, you will have no issues with doing a factory reset after getting those updates as some recommend.  But if you spent hours getting your apps in place, you probably won't want to start again from scratch after a factory reset.  Despite that (wanting to be sure I had the best possible performance) I decided to do the factory reset -- after all it was just a matter or waiting for all those downloads again as I hadn't really done any special customization.In the end, I found that doing the factory reset didn't seem to provide any better performance for me -- it was great before and after with no lag.  I suspect that those who did get an improvement had not downloaded all 3 updates before they did a reset.  Can anyone confirm or deny that?  (Edit:  Max posted agreement with this.  Thanks, Max.)So now I'm into seriously configuring this thing.  Since the Nexus 7 doesn't have a memory card slot, all my apps were downloaded into the Note main storage.  Any suggestions on what and how to best transfer stuff to the 64 Gig microchip?  I assume some apps will run better from main storage?  I plan to put all my data, music and pics on the microchip.I'm not having problems or lag with Touchwiz, but I'll try another launcher and post about that later.  (Edit:  Not sure now that I will actually bother -- TouchWiz is fine for me.)So that's my preliminary rating based on the fact that everything I've done and tried out has gone well and the device itself appears to be in perfect condition.  I'll edit this in a couple of weeks to update my experience, but up front, I TOTALLY disagree with the review that complained extensively about the poor build quality.  Sure it's plastic, but the fit and finish is great.  NOTHING appears to be loose or vibrates.I also want to comment about the experience I had with Amazon on the shipping.  UPS completely screwed it up and reported the tablet as delivered on time even though I never saw it.  The first Amazon CSR seemed to get things all taken care up, but I didn't get any followup.  After I called back AGAIN, the support team worked together to first of all ensure I got to someone who would take care of the problem and each person involved took responsibility to see that the handoffs were completed properly.  Not ideal, but I got my Note 10.1 with only a small delay.___________Ok, these are the suggestions I gleaned from the reviews and comments of others.  Feel free to use or not as you choose -- these items are copied as found from different people so they are a bit disjointed and redundant:NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues. Go to Settings/General/About Device/Software Update to get it. Mine did not automatically update.If you continue to have issues, you should do a factory reset after installing the newest update for the device. To check for updates manually, go to about device in options.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.If you are still complaining about lag, I would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like Nova Launcher.NOVA is good, but I've always liked Apex better.  With Apex, I turned on ""Tablet UI"" mode, which makes it look like stock Android (no bottom bar, no dock, app drawer icon in upper right, square-outline tablet animation for panning desktop, etc). I love stock Android so for me, Apex in tablet-UI mode is great.After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great.Cons: Samsung overlays android with their system touchwiz. It has its good but it has its bad like major Memory hog. I'd recommend using one of the launchers such as nova launcher for a more customization of an experienceUSB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it.Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7"" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome.Google Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities. To allow the Dolphin Browser to have its Flash option work, you must download an Android 4.0's version of flash on the tablet, anyone version will do. Google Android flash player archives and proceed to the Adobe site. Flash has no longer made anymore updates for android devices, therefore you must do it this way. Go to dolphin browser, hit menu, hit settings, turn on flash. And now you have flash capabilities on your Dolphin browser, no other browser has flash capability as of now. I must tell you it is a pleasure to watch Amazon prime videos using the dolphin browser, and at the same time multi-task with another browser like chrome to read stuff on the internet or use S Note on the right side while watching a video for class on the left side.LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:  -------------Turn on developer options by tapping ""build number"" found in the ""about"" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice. Once in S voice, hit the menu button which is located left of the home button. Choose the option to ""not initiate S voice by double tapping the home button"". You will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen, however it won't be snappy until there is an update.In addition, the more apps you have on your device, the more cache data your device will accumulate. Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master.  -------------Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location.-The Touchwiz gallery app is TERRIBLE, it draws thumbnails every time you open the app, so if you have lots of photos, it hangs/lags sot bad that it can render the device unusable.[I use QuickPic and it handles everything fine](For people that dont have 4K+ photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging, dropbox photo displaying, Google+ photo syncing/displaying, Facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery)??? If you have the Galaxy Note phone, transitioning to this tablet is super easy in that the user interface is practically the same. And once you link your Google account, it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you. You'll still need to download Amazon apps individually- but you'll need to allow downloads from ""unknown sources"" to get them.I will say there are some things you won't discover right away; settings that are buried in other menus and menus that you discover in apps after days of using them.Many application features are difficult to discover. Always press the menu button, just in case!Turn off the news/home button association by pressing the menu button while the news is on screen. You'll see the option to turn it off there.The S-Note can go into what I'd call ""Note-Only"" mode, meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows, only the 100% pure note, so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(After going into the edit mode) With 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release, and it will go into that note-only mode, and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button, and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode (back to the regular edit mode).I've only had it a few days and the first thing I did was download Nova Launcher, program it to ""remote"" my TV and to prevent possible lag went into ""Settings"", ""General"", ""About Device"", tapped ""Build Number"" 7 x's. This opens the ""Developer Options"" tab, then under ""Drawing"" turned OFF ""Transition Animation Scale"". You can go to YouTube and watch this tutorial presented by TheDigitalDigest.

Coming at the time of Punk the Manhatten Transfer's greatest contribtion to music was probably to screw up all the rock critics as they turned back the clock into the 40s and 50s.Not only did they have a chart topper with the 50s song Chanson d'Amour which had charted then for both Art & Dottie Todd and the Fontane Sisters but went on to chart 8 more times into the mid 80s with a slew of covers.One hit wonders in their own country the Transfer were bigger here and TV regulars.Their beginnings were in line of descent from Cashman Pistilli & West and are pretty hard to find unless you but a CD called Wop Ding A Ling-Classic New York doowop from Time/Brent/Shad.Here you find a group called the Chevrons one of whose members was called Dennis Minogue who for some reason changed his name to Terry Cashman in the mid 60s and became a hit songwriter (Sunday Will Never Be The Same) after which he joined a trio An LP on MFP issued after the success of the Transfer with little info to connect them was called Jukin' and was I think made by Capitol,"07 22, 2012",Bigger in the U K,1342915200,CDVinyl
"It actually works. Yes, like most of the other reviews, the video picture quality is poor, almost blurry looking. It took about two hours to get it to work on my andriod phone, my IOS ipad, and my new Win-8 desktop but it does work.I was able to scan the QR-code on the bottom without ever having installed any code scanning software previously. All this does is rapidly input the cameras specific network address and name into the software, or you gotta do it by hand. This worked on both the LG android phone and the ipad. The Win8.0 desktop found the camera without any codes being scanned.And the weirdest part was that the local express delivery company, which rarely delivers on time or to the correct address, did deliver early and to the right place (On-Trac) which was the real show-stopper!This is not, repeat: NOT plug-n-play.There is no manual included and the ethernet cable supplied is rather short, so I used my own.

"I'm sorry this thing didn't work our. I so looked forward to listening to my 300 songs on an MP3 player on the go or while traveling to Dallas. I Received my first Coby MP620 4 GB Video MP3 Player with FM Radio (Red) about a week ago and after I Synced all my songs to the unit all I could play was about 8 songs by Hank Williams,  The pictures I downloaded lasted about 8 hours , then they were gone,  it would't even download/sync any videos.  The only thing I could get it to do was play the FM Radio,  does that real good.  I Immediately sent it back to Amazon,  A very neat system I might add, the return system they have.  Really worked good, I'm real happy with that department.  I basicly really like dealing with Amazon all together. Anyway, I received my replacement MP3 player(the exact some make and model Coby MP620) today and put songs in it again and tried videos again and pictures, and none of them worked.  It did finally put in several songs but it still would only play about 8 of them, all the others were just scratchy noises , not music. I wish I knew what to do. I guess I am not meant to have or enjoy an MP3 Player.  I guess at least I have an FM Radio I can listen to and it is a pretty Red.Thanks for the effort though, maybe I just need a more expensive one next time.Thanks againSincerelyPhillip E.

"This is one of the most frustrating products I've used in years, and I'm regretting ever setting it up.So, if you want to know more, here's what you get: a small box (don't own an Apply TV, but it appears comparable) covered in way too many clear protective stickers, a smallish power brick, and the clunkiest remote this side of 1975.  Let's start with the remote (since it may be why you don't want it): it's so big it looks like a capybara next to a computer mouse and like (insert way too large object here) next to a Boxee Box remote.  Granted it has a keyboard (like the aforementioned Boxee Box) and a touchpad (not like a mouse, but aims for the same purpose).  I think it's also motion sensitive, so if you strap a Wiimote to a mouse and a keyboard, this may be better.  Otherwise it makes a lackluster remote.  It does offer Bluetooth connectivity forgoing line of site limitations, but so does a Boxee Box remote.  It's also not back lit (seriously you could put a 100 watt light bulb in that brick).  Oh, here's the kicker.  The damn thing will constantly register ""i"" inputs.  This starts a query in the search tool, which will overlay on what you really want to watch (I'll get to that later).  At first I thought that my cat was getting back at me for some perceived slight (he can be vengeful), but no, it's just wacky.Onto the box.  I've never had it overheat on me, but I haven't used it for too much.  It supports Amazon streaming, which sadly is a huge plus (why so hard to access Amazon?  Netflix is EVERYWHERE) as well as the usual suspects.  Being Google TV, you'd expect loads of apps, but selection is disappointing.  You can find most of what you can on Roku and more than Boxee Box, plus the Chrome browser is excellent.  Actually Chrome is the shining star for the whole contraption.  On the hardware side we've established that the box is small, covered in protective stickers, and allegedly overheats (not my experience).  It's (like all Google TV devices) also designed to daisy chain with your DVR, cable box, satellite receiver et al.  That's an interesting idea but falls short.  First no HDMI cable.  I've grown OK with a box needing one HDMI cable and not having one, but somehow this one seems to need two, and has none.  Granted I assume you had one for the other device down the line, but it still seems lame.  Furthermore, the box will pass through content until it feels the need to interject.  The dreaded random ""i"" key presses my remote creates out of thin air brings up a search and hijacks my TV.  Ugh!  At least the box is small and can be placed anywhere due to the remote's use of radio waves.The software really doesn't seem that well finished, and it's not 100% Google (who's not blame free due to their lackluster Google TV adventure).  It works, and honestly is the least of your concerns.  The browser works well, and I guess were this 1998 would be enough.  It's not, and the device is best left ignored.  For now I try, but it cries for help ""i""!  Oh, I almost forgot that I struggled to set it up the first time, as the setup was broken.  It hung on not being able to talk to my cable box (pretty common Motorola Uverse box), which was required in the setup (it also couldn't recognize a Panasonic TV no matter how many letters I tried typing in). Unplugging and plugging it in again fixed it, but I guess that should have let me know what I was getting in to.I'm trying to see how much resolve I can muster for giving it more time, but it may just be apathy.

"I would agree with most people who are reviewing this product at Amazon or anywhere else, that 500mA is quite low for today's standards.  However, whether 500mA is low or not, this is something the consumer should consider before a purchase of such a product.Being like everyone else, of course I have an iPad.  I have not even tried plugging in my iPad to this charger because I know FOR SURE it doesn't provide enough current to charge it.  However, I did search high and low for a charger that provides 500mA, since the actual purpose was to charge my old Motorola S9 headphones.  I had since lost the charger that came with it and the S9 only charges with a 500mA source.I have LOTS of USB chargers, ranging from 750mA to 1.5A, and none of them charged my S9 until I got the Belkin.  There is nothing else to say about the 120V outlets.  They are what they are.In regards to the ""Mini"", it is quite BIG to be called a ""Mini"", I do agree.  Probably Belkin could have moved the USB ports to the face of the product instead of the side to make it thinner.  It would be a little longer, but that wouldn't be too bad.  Or like another reviewer said, remove one AC port and replace it with the USB.  Really... the cables in your house can only carry 15A of current.  How many things are people going to plug in?  This product is handy for the traveler who doesn't want to carry multiple USB adapters (then the 500mA issues come into play), but when traveling, 500mA is better than nothing.","12 24, 2012","Good product, but be aware of your specific requirements",1356307200,Electronics

"When I picked this out of the rental bin, I thought 'Hey, this ought to be fun.'  With that ridiculous title, I figured that the movie would be an over-the-top exploitation/comedy, which is an acquired taste, sure, but it takes all kinds, right?Asun Ortega stars as Sister Sarah, the nun on the cover, who, after taking her vows finds that the Lord's work isn't exactly how she pictured it would be.  Forced by the church elders to pack cocaine (and do so in the nude, of course), she then acts as a mule to transport the drugs to the local distributors, a motorcycle gang known as Los Muertos.  The deal goes bad, and Sister Sarah is sold into prostitution and hooked on heroin.  During one of her trips, she evidently (it's never shown) hears a message from God, one inspiring her to seek vengeance for herself and for her sisters.Like I said, I expected a comedy, even if it was going to be a sleazy one, but everyone plays it straight here.  You get a lot of nudity, rapes, murders, lesbianism; as much as possible for the director (Joseph Guzman) to throw on the screen it seems, so if that's your thing, then you are going to love this movie.  That probably won't come as a surprise if you've already watched his first film,Run Bitch Run.  He also gives extra attention to disrespecting the church's conventions (again, not surprising given his previous movie), even over and above the little synopsis I gave, so if you think that would make you uncomfortable, then you should avoid this film at all costs.  With the title, you might think that was obvious, but the amount of anger leveled at the clergy's corruption is beyond even what's suggested there.Here's the deal: If you're into exploitation movies, you're probably going to watch this.  I am, and did, and I wouldn't discourage anyone else from it, if they are also into this sort of thing.  But it all feels pretty flat to me.  For some reason I never could really get on Asun Ortega's side, which is a must if you're going to root for her when she starts wreaking holy vengeance.  And in the final act, as the members of Los Muertos meet their judgment day, it was just bang-bang-bang, and then it was pretty much over, except their leader's shrinkage moment.  I was at least expecting some inventive death scenes, but it's all pretty conventionalMost of the women in this film are rarely dressed, so there's that, except they aren't really all that attractive.  Actually, they look like they fit the part, either as skanky strippers from biker bars or as plain jane nuns.  David Castro, as the leader of Los Muertos, has a fairly commanding presence in the movie, kind of like a more grizzled Antonio Banderas.  At least he (Castro) looks like he was having fun in the process of filming.  And I have to admit that Ortega looks pretty sweet in her avenging angel garb.Obviously the movie sets up for a part II, so we'll see what new nunnery depths Guzman has in store for us.  Or not, depending on how sleazy you find this first installment.  And it is, without a doubt, one of the more sleazy movies I've ever seen, barring some rough blue movies from the seventies.  That's probably what this film comes closest to, with a dose ofI Spit On Your Grave (1978).  The difference is that the director of the original I Spit On Your Grave, Meir Zarchi, had some sympathy for his main character.  Guzman, not so much.","06 13, 2012",To sleazy for me,1339545600,MovieTV

When you first unbox these triggers they feel a little light/cheap but once you put the batteries in them you won't want them to be much heavier. I am highly satisfied with this product, and would recommend it to anyone!!","06 19, 2013",Inexpensive not cheap!,1371600000,Electronics

"The Etymotic HF3 headphones were my daily headphones and recently passed away after two years of dutiful service. After experiencing their quality, I knew that I was probably in for disappointment if I tried any other model or brand. However, the HF3 (and apparently most of the Etymotic line) is that they simply are too loud -- I constantly had my volume in the lowest range.With a deep breath I ordered these ETY3's. After returning the first set which was DOA, I put the working second pair to the test. I'm satisfied with the sound quality and pleased to find them to be just as comfortable. Most importantly, I can now have my output volume at a reasonable level which gives me more space to turn my media down. Fortunately, this set accepts the the standard ear plugs.Durability certainly taken a hit at this lower price point. Surprisingly, the ETY3's do not have replaceable filters which will certainly be a problem over the long term. In general, the chord and body doesn't have the same ""Wow $150 headphone"" feel, but that doesn't bother me too much. Personally I think that the gloss black finish is a nuisance.","04 5, 2013",Superb; preferred over HF3 though not as durable,1365120000,Electronics
This case was available for a really good price for my new iPad 4.  It fits like a glove and has the magnetized cover to shut off and start up the iPad without using the power button every time.  It provides plenty of protection even in limited drop scenarios.  I wouldn't want to put it up against a substantial drop which I wouldn't recommend for any iPad but the Apple products take an amazing amount of abuse when these cirumstances occur.The only thing that would improve it is if there was a holder for a stylus which I like to keep available.  It works great as a good sturdy case for everyday use.  The folks at iLounge.com recommended it highly which was the primary motivator to looking at this product from the start.  I highly recommend this case to anyone who is looking for quality protection,"02 13, 2014",Strong functional product!,1392249600,Electronics

"This is my first mechanical keyboard so I don't have anything to compare to. The Cherry Brown keys are a little louder than I was expecting but I still like it. It sometimes wakes up my baby if she's in my lap and I start typing, just as a reference. The blue lighting has four brightness settings including off.

"Let me preference the fact I did return these headphones and bought the Photive BTH3 Bluetooth headphones (they are more expensive $20 more).  I originally purchased the Kinivo Bluetooth car audio kit and loved it (and still do), so I bought these thinking they would be just as great.I don&#8217;t know if I am in the minority or not on this, but everything I read about headphones is how great they are because people have big heads and ears, well I don&#8217;t.  So whenever I see those reviews, I run from the product because if they fit big heads and ears, they will drape over my head and past my ears.  This is why I returned them; they gave me massive headaches because they pulled my small ears away from my head.  I could no longer wear them.It real was a shame because the positives are that the sound quality is good not great.  One thing I think people have to take into consideration is the music device you are utilizing.  I use a Samsung Note 3 and an Apple iPod so I can adjust the EQ and that aides the sound a ton.  Everyone will have different experiences depending on that.  Overall the quality was good, but they do not get very loud.  They get loud enough for me, but I don&#8217;t like loud music, so I know in comparison some people would be disappointed with that.  I was able to turn my phone all the up and max these out as I ran and they were just loud enough.The Bluetooth aspect is amazing super easy and connects right away.The quality is ok, I actually was expecting better, but I do realize they are $30.The best thing about these headphones was the mic.  I am an avid talker and wanted a good Bluetooth for working out/running and talking.  The mic is amazing people actually preferred me on this headset than to my phone, so an extra A++ for that.  The working out and running part, they were great, they stayed in place and didn&#8217;t bob up and down.  I couldn&#8217;t hear any material shaking or the music quality dropping off, just the headache that ensued.In conclusion I am sad they didn&#8217;t work because the price was right and I have liked Kinivo products before.  I would say people with small heads stay away because they will pull on your eras and it hurts (again I wouldn&#8217;t say my head is tiny like a shrunken head, actually pretty average for a female in her 20&#8217;s).  Otherwise they are pretty good.  The only other negative was really the sound quality I wanted a little better.  I compared with my husband&#8217;s ThinkSound wood noise cancelling, so I am a but spoiled when it comes to comparisons.","04 23, 2014",So Sad,1398211200,CellPhone

"It's classic tale, but not cliche' in any way.  The blue collar couple marry too young for the usual reason and go on to have another child.  It's the sixties so he works and she raises the family.  Life has become routine without much spark especially for the wife who ends up having a summer fling with the &#34;Blouse Man&#34;.  He wakes her up to feelings she put aside when she became a young wife and mother.  I won't say much more as you have to see how it all plays out yourself.  It could have been a boring, predictable story, but it's not.  It's about the real ways real life sometimes interferes with our dreams and it's about deciding to want what you have.

"The Command SmartPhone Organizer does just what it claims to do: Hold your phone on a vertical surface. If you are familiar with Command hooks organizers, the adhesive supplied with this phone organizer is different. The hooks generally come with a white foam-like adhesive pad. This organizer comes with a clear thin tape adhesive. The instructions say it needs 15 inches of clearance below the product for removing the adhesive - keep that in mind when trying to select a location to mount the organizer. I have not tested how well it actually comes off.I have a rather large smart phone: Samsung Galaxy S2. The Command Organizer has ample room for my phone without the case, but with the case, it will only partially slide down.

"Look, this is a small, portable speaker. It is not going to sound as good as even a basic but decent stereo speakers in a room hooked up to a decent receiver or amp. Even cheap bookshelf speakers (which nowadays, can sound incredible) and the most basic receiver (a Sony or Yamaha for under $250) would sound way better in most cases. But that is three boxes you have to place in three different places with wires. Plus built in Airplay or Bluetootrh on the receiver or AppleTV for iTunes and internet radio or a CD player...BUT, for the size, portability, with Bluetooth, and the price (now around $80 on sale with no case) this is about as good as one could expect. And it is pretty good sounding.If you crank it, it can go quite loud BUT be sure you set your iOS device or smart phone audio app volume setting at about 75%-85% volume. Not all the way up or you get distortion! If you play your audio recordings via the Audiophile app for iOS (free), and use the MAXXaudio feature (one time paid) set to small powered speakers, the Soundfreaq SFQ-04 sounds incredible. [...]The only downside is that Bluetooth compresses audio in transmission but, I have tried out other (better, more costly) Bluetooth systems just like this or slightly larger and, this one sounds pretty darn good. Really, as best as you can get with Bluetooth for the size and price.Regardless, there is also a mini jack in the back which you can use and, irrespective of bad MP3 data, it delivers the best actual stereo fidelity sound (as long as you use Apple Lossless or other lossless codec). Ideally, I would like to see Soundfreaq add on Airplay which is not compressed and also sounds terrific.It has been mentioned that the stereo separation enhancer UQ3 is not so great, and I would agree. Compared to other stereo enhancer features by other audio companies over the years, it is the most ""mild"" of them all. On an older Sony XDR-S10HDiP Clock radio with Apple Dock cradle I have (also well rated for sound by owners), the separation feature is immediate, apparent, and enhances the listening experience. But for the Soundfreaq SFQ-04, this is a minor problem and, I would not let it stop you from buying it. I also suspect that UQ3 is designed for a listener to be farther away from the SFQ-04 than on a desk nearby (or testing in a massive store space like Target or BestBuy). Placed on a shelf or table in a small room, it and the UQ3 sounds much better.On a form factor and practical level, the SFQ-04 is a nice design with an actual wire speaker grill. The only flaw is that the tilt it employs requires a nearly perfect flat surface to sit on or it tends to fall forward onto the flat bottom of the main surface. In short, it is not made for a messy desk with papers under it.The USB port for recharging devices only is really appreciated. I use it to charge and power while using the SFQ-04 rather than use up a port on my computer.I wish Soundfreaq included the case for it rather than an overpriced accessory or costlier option (the cheaper of the two options). But like most people, I did not know I could buy it WITH the case as an option and, it was too late. Again, they should include it or, at least a simple but rugged satchel for transport of it and the power supply when camping, on trips, events. etc. It does not have to be the fancy folding case. In the mean time, I think a 1970s style tube sock or velvet liquor bag over it are the only options to protect it... ;-)So, in the end, I have bought one for my work office. The price, sound quality, and size combo was too good to pass up. I also bought one for my sister as a birthday gift, and a month later, I bought another one for my home office!Note that one cannot use this as a speaker for an alarm clock on your iOS device (or any device). If the Soundfreaq SFQ-04 is not getting a BT signal, it shuts off. I wish it had a sleep option where the LED went very dim or off but the BT was still active. Then, when the iPhone alarm next to your bed went off, the Soundfreaq SFQ-04 across the room could come to life and sound came from it instead of the tiny iPhone speaker. (Yes, there are alarm apps that let you wake up to radio.)","08 26, 2013","For the size and price, quite good but some design and technical quirks.",1377475200,Electronics
"I have been a resident evil fan since the beginning. I played all the main RE titles that came out on various systems over the years. When RE4 came out I thought the game would be similar to all the other RE's that came before it. Obviously it wasnt. And thats not a bad thing either. If you liked RE4 than u will like this one too.The gameplay is very similar to RE4. Only difference is that the graphics are better and the action is more intense. You still cannot walk while you have ur guns aimed at someone but thats not really a big deal to me.The graphics, as i mentioned, are really nice. That shouldnt be a surprise there. The acting in the game is pretty good too. But its the action that makes this RE the best one yet to me.There really isnt any puzzles that needs to be solved in this game as in previous titles. ITs pretty straight forwarD And u can get through the entire game without needing a strategy guide. You may need one for a few small parts but for the most part  the game is easy as far as navigating.If the navigating part is easy then the monsters are the difficult part. There are 4 difficulty levels. The first 3 (amateur, normal, vetern) are available to u right at the begining. The 4th difficulty (professional) wont be available until you complete the veteran difficulty once. I havent played veteran yet but based on some strategy guides I looked at its tough. The monsters are a lot stronger and they do more damage to u than u to them. And professional mode is 10 times as difficult as veteran. But that is the way it is with all games so if you play this game a lot then professional  mode wont b too intense. Also, this game has a feature where the longer you go without dying the harder it will become. The difficulty scale ranges from 0-10. Zero being the easiest. There is a limit though. If you are playing amateur mode (easy), for example, then the difficulty will go from 0-4. It wont go higher than that until you choose a harder difficulty. If you are playing normal it will go from 2-6 or something like that. Of course if you keep dying then the difficulty will stay at the lowest setting based on what difficulty u are using until you get good at the game. Professional mode, however, stays at a 10 difficulty level no matter how many times you die. Veteran mode maxes out at 9.They gave a lot of weapons in the game. Several different pistols, magnums, shotguns, etc. Lots of guns in this game. And most weapons can be upgraded as well. Just like in RE4, you find jewels and money in game that you can use to buy better weapons and and also upgrade them. The only ammo you can buy is grenade launcher ammo. Bullets and even grenades that u throw have to be found as you play the game. Ammo is scarce in this game as is health packs. (yes they still have green herbs and first aid spray cans).RE5 has always been about rewarding players when you beat the game and this one is no different. Ammo is scarce, yes, but you can get unlimited ammo for all the guns in the game except the grenade launcher i think. The way you get unlimited ammo is u upgrade that particular weapon fully and go to bonus features afterwards. You have to purchase the infinite ammo pack for the particular gun you want and then you have to turn it on. Its a really nice feature and you also can unlock speacial weapons that u only get after u upgrade a certain gun. If you beat the game under 5 hours you get the infinte rocket launcher.I dont have any major gripes about the game except i wish you can move around while aiming but maybe if RE6 comes out they might add that. This game is really fun and it has a lot of replay value to it. There are other features you unlock too after beating it once but you have to check them out yourselves.If you like RE games and 3rd person shooters than you might want to check this one out.","01 1, 2012",This game keeps the series alive.,1325376000,VideoGames
"As ""Shrek Ever After"" opens, the warmhearted ogre is suffering through a bit of a midlife crisis.  Having been firmly ensconced in marital and domestic bliss for quite some time now, Shrek suddenly finds himself pining for the days when he could be a real, full-time ogre, roaming the countryside and terrorizing the general populace - instead of changing diapers, pushing strollers, and signing autographs for fans who remember those long-gone glory days when he could still strike fear into the hearts of men.In the be-careful-what-you-wish-for/you-don't-know-what-you've-got-till-it's-gone scenario that Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke have concocted for this fourth entry in the series, Shrek (Mike Myers) allows himself to be tricked into essentially signing his life away to the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin (the excellent Walt Dohrn) in exchange for a chance to once again become a full-fledged, undomesticated ogre for a day.  We then get a new spin on ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Shrek learns what the world would have been like had he never been born.  He also has to get Fiona (Cameron Diaz) - the beautiful princess by day/ugly ogre by night who, in this alternate universe, is now the leader of a band of freedom-fighting ogres - to fall in love with him all over again.Though a definite improvement over the drab and disappointing ""Shrek the Third"" from 2007, ""Shrek Ever After,"" directed by Mike Mitchell, never quite achieves the level of cleverness and wit that the first two installments did - which is a high bar indeed for anyone in this business.  Still, the mix of Fractured Fairy Tale revisionism, pop culture references and recognizable pop tunes remains a winning one for the most part, and there is just enough sentiment to lift our spirits without stranding us in a puddle of goo.  Plus, all the great sidekicks are back, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), and Cookie (Craig Robinson), and the voice work and animation are, as always, first-rate.  In fact the voiceover cast reads like a who's-who of well-known actors and performers:  Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Jon Hamm (""Mad Men""), Jane Lynch (""Glee""), Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Larry King.

"Coming from an older Harmony 800 series and the newerLogitech Harmony 900, I'm pretty familiar with the product line and have some expectations that are already set. Unfortunately, the 915 doesn't meet them.I wasn't terribly impressed with having to find a home (and power outlet) for the IR blaster, though I understood that this wasn't going to make my iPad magically grow an IR transmitter. The puck seems unnecessarily large, though.Getting the software up and running wasn't a massive chore, but Logitech seems to push you towards more showy content steering than functionality. So where the Harmony remotes are functional, easy to use, and reasonably responsive, the 915 turns your iPad in to a kludgy Swiss Army Knife of media consumption that doesn't do anything very well.Yeah, it can give me programming info, but DirecTV, Comcast, and other providers have their own apps that do that, and do it better -- not to mention the IMDB app and site. Logitech doesn't seem to understand that changing the sound field on your receiver is probably more important, and that the actual control and functionality is what should be selling this.For what it's worth, I was using the DirecTV app to control my satellite receiver over wi-fi, the wi-fi card and iPad app on my LG HDTV (which controls the volume on my receiver over HDMI). Switching between those apps isn't elegant by any stretch of the imagination -- but it's actually preferable to using the Harmony app.You can usually find a refurbishedHarmony Onefor the same price as this. Unless you absolutely MUST control everything you possibly can with your iPad / iPhone, you're way better off getting the Harmony One and using your iPad for stuff like the DirecTV app, HBO GO, and IMDB.","02 2, 2012",You're better off with the remote.,1328140800,Electronics

"For those who don't know Kapustin's music it's a wonderful blend of classical and jazz styles. There are three works on this CD: The Sonata No 1, the Sonata No. 2 and a selection of 13 of the 24 Preludes in Jazz Style from the composer's Op.53. Of course Russian composer Kapustin is not the first composer to have blended popular music idioms with classical form - Ravel, Shostakovich and Gershwin all used jazz music in their compositions, and many composers have used popular dance melodies in a formal arrangement. The works here are played by British pianist Steven Osborne who has given many fine broadcast performances with several of the best British orchestras. This recording was made in 1999 and provides 70 minutes of entertaining, and sometimes challenging, piano music. All the pieces are played exactly as written, without improvisation.Nikolai Kapustin: Piano Music","09 20, 2012",Steven Osborne plays piano music by Nikolai Kapustin,1348099200,CDVinyl

"By: RevitAgatha Christie's ""Death on the Nile"" staring Peter Ustinov as Poirot was sensational and one of Christie's most famous mysteries. The story was set in 1937 and is superb. The 1978 movie, directed by John Guillermin, is a stunner and the ending is unbelievable.The cast is loaded with stars including Colonel Race (David Niven), who was a wonderful batman for Poirot (Peter Ustinov) and danced a stylish tango with Mrs. Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury) at the Cataract Hotel in Assuan. The trip up the Nile, aboard the paddle wheel boat Karnak, was beautiful. The stop at the Temple of Ammon in Karnak was a chance to see some of the ancient wonders of Egypt. The attempted murder of Linnet Doyle (Lois Chiles) and her new husband Simon Doyle (Simon Mac Corkindale) by Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy), Linnet's American Trustee, in the Hypostyle Hall of the Temple of Ammon was a terrifyingly close call. The next day, at the temple of Abu-Simbel, Jacqueline de Bellefort, (Mia Farrow), the abandoned fianc&eacute;, again taunted Linnet.Poirot attempted to convince Jacie to back off and leave the newlyweds alone. But Jacie answered ""If love can't live in your heart, evil will do just as well."" The sparring continued until Jacie shot Simon in the leg, and Linnet was found dead. From there things got even worse, both Louise (Jane Berkin) and Mrs. Otterbourne were killed. The clues keep appearing and continued to get tangled. It became difficult to track who was where and who had an alibi for what. Finally Poirot put his little grey sells to work, and announced that there would be a gathering of everyone in the salon where he would reveal everything. What happened was unbelievable and it did surprise everyone.This is one of Agatha Christie's finest works; it was a stellar performance by Peter Ustinov. Ustinov manages to bring just the right amount of relaxed perspective into a very serious situation. It you have a copy of this mystery staring David Suchet as Poirot you can make a direct comparison of the two. The later interpretations of Poirot by David Suchet have gotten a little overly critical and intense for my taste. His earlier performances when he had Col. Hastings and Miss Lemon were much better. I prefer this version with Ustinov playing Poirot but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.. This DVD is a must have for everyone with any interest in British mysteries or in Agatha Christie's work.","01 18, 2014",A Trip up the Nile,1390003200,MovieTV

"Only a couple of hours into BioShock Infinite, I made a post saying the art design was second to none, the story was compelling, etc. After finishing the game I'd still stand by all of that (only not as enthusiastically). I'd also stand by my statement that caused so much controversy -- the gameplay in BioShock Infinite is mediocre.Here's why (if you haven't completed the game yet, you may want to scroll down to the ""END SPOILERS"" section to read the rest of the spoiler-free review):SPOILERS(including end battle spoilers)The gameplay is limited like an FPS from the early 90s or a generic military shooter (Call of Duty) from this century. There's nothing to do, gameplay-wise, but shoot. And shoot. And shoot some more. Yes, you get to combine vigor/plasmids/whatever-the-kids-are-calling-it-these-days, and that's fun for a couple of hours but you find the most powerful combo and basically upgrade it to full and stick with it. Same with the weapons.Then, after an incredibly awesome Shantytown section and revolution section the game stops even trying to be something more and becomes Just Another Shooter. Wave after wave of bad guys. Pretty much non-stop from the section where you have to find the 3 tears to the end. And then there's that end.Oh, that end ...Until the end section the game is INSANELY easy (on Medium settings, which is how I always play through a game the first time, as story is at least as important to me as the challenge -- which is why I save the hardest difficulties for last). Then the end puts you in that airship which is at first simply monotonous and then devolves into something awful. You finally get to the top deck (I laughed when -- after an hour of non-stop shooting, Elizabeth says, ""Only 3 more decks"") and everyone and their mother is shooting at the power core thing to take it down. It's total overkill.There's nearly as many bad guys to fight in the airship and around the airship than there was the rest of the game. Again, total overkill and all art goes out the window and a generic FPS takes its place. Sure, you can call in Big Bird, but Big Deal? No wonder Infinite didn't have multiplayer -- it didn't need it -- the last third of the game is nothing but multiplayer you play offline. Waves of enemies and shooting and swearing -- just without the fifteen-year-old boys swearing at their mommies over a headset.ENDSPOILERSAnyway, I'd still this game a 5 out of 10 for the art design. But gameplay wise? It's no better than a 3 out of 10 (and that's being generous). The much hyped skylines were a useless gimmick to stop people from noticing this was Just Another Shooter(TM).I have literally never been this disappointed with a game. I loved the first BioShock. I thought the second was decent (with FAR better gameplay mechanics and variety than Infinite). The third was pretty and had some compelling ideas that reminded me of debates I was involved in back in college. Nothing that thought-provoking, but despite what Ken Levine and eager-to-please critics claimed, this is just a game, after-all (too bad that I, like so many, wanted it to be something more).BioShock Infinite isn't revolutionary. The first half makes you think it MAY be, but in the end, it ends up being no more than a mediocre shooter that drags on at least two hours too long and runs out of ideas 2/3rds of the way through (if that). A game with the potential of being a game-changer (pun intended) ends up being nothing more than a bore. A shame.","03 26, 2013","In the end, it's Just Another Shooter(TM)",1364256000,VideoGames
"This is definitely a throwback to a different generation of horror.  There's no gore and very little in the way of violence (unless you want to include the abominable way in which the older brother treats his younger sibling).  For the most part, this is more about the things that go bump in the night: scary sounds, sinister shadows, your darkest secrets revealed.  As the filmmakers state in the bonus feature, this is a ""traditional scary movie.""  Translation, it could easily play on TV with little to no editing.  Think of it as a long episode from The Outer Limits.  The plot is a well-worn stock scenario: your worst fears realized.  It's pretty basic fare with only a few surprises (Dick Miller's silent walk-on being one of the few).  But it is slickly done, with one fabulous set piece and a few effective moments.  Sadly, Bruce Dern is entirely wasted in a dead end role that gives him precious little to do.I'd say it was okay for its type, but nothing I'd care to watch again.","01 13, 2013","""The DARKNESS is coming!""",1358035200,MovieTV

"UN46ES6100 (but this review could easily apply to the 40,50,55 and 60 inch models) PLEASE READ!Let me start off by stating that I am rating this pretty much solely on the picture quality, because the Smart Hub on this is completely junk. So why would I still give this TV 4 stars when the selling feature on this is the Smart Tv feature, because the TV itself is absolutely stunning when it comes to picture quality.I've accepted the fact that the Smart TV feature is garbage on this TV. Sadly Samsung is aware that they drop the ball big time on creating a good Smart TV. That being said though you probably won't find to many TV's that have a good Smart TV function and picture quality as good as this (except the Sony Bravia......but it will cost you big time). Between my friends and I we have tried almost all the new TV's that have come out, and to be honest none of the new Smart TV's have impressed me. LG comes pretty close with the whole package for a good price, but still (in my opinion) does not compare to this TV when it comes to picture quality.The apps are attached through the Smart Hub which means, yes, they also run slow. I run my streaming apps through my Blu-Ray player and it looks great. It's weird that an external source such as a Blu-ray player runs apps better that a tv that has apps and software built into it. Smart Hub is absolutely useless on this TV, everything from the browser to the apps are ridiculously slow. I give the Smart Hub feature a 1 out of 10. It works, but barely. This feature is not ready for prime time.Now, down to the nitty gritty. The reason this TV is still great is because I personally love the look of their Auto-Motion feature. Some say it looks ""soap opery"", but I love it. You can turn off Automotion easily and it still delivers in 120hz mode. This TV has a whooping 5,000,000:1 dynamic contrast that completely delivers. The picture quality is very crisp and colors are very vibrant (Actually to be honest, out of the box it's too vibrant. You will have to play around with it. Check the bottom of this post, I'll supply a professionally calibrated configuration to help some of you). HDTV looks great. Everything is so clear it does almsot seem like there is no screen dividing you from the movie. Blu-Rays on this is an experience all to itself. So in conclusion for picture I give this a 10 out of 10.Sound is decent on this. It's not bad. It does have it's moments with low end bass a little. Coarse my theory on sound on a TV like this is, if you bought this TV your probably like me and had some inkling that your future foretold a certain sound system......maybe a nice sound bar. So in conclusion for sound I give this 7 out of 10. Very passable sound for sure.Comparing a the UN46ES6100 to the UN46EH600 (Similar Samsung TV minus the Smart TV)Here is a valuble piece of information. If your looking for a Samsung TV with all the same qualification but no Smart TV feature, go with the UN46EH6000 (40,46,50,55,60). Although this TV does match up in every way, the picture quality is a little less (about half million in the dynamic contrast department, which actually isn't much when considering the naked eye) on the UN46EH6000, but you will save about 300 bucks. By the way, if you compare these two TV using Amazon they will tell you the match up, but after talking to Samsung they gave me the real specs. These TV's are comparable, but not the same. They would leave you to think the the Smart feature is the only difference. My personal opinion, get the UN46ES6100. In the long run you want the best picture quality. Right?In final conclusion, I really like this TV .....a lot (the UN46ES6100, bad on topic). If you read the other reviews the biggest beef is clearly with the Smart Hub, which to be honest is completely accurate. In fact this problem is not isolated to this model, it would seem that all the 2012 Samsung's that attempted the Smart Hub failed miserably. I bought this TV for $899 at Costco and to be honest I have not come across a TV yet that compares for the price. In fact this TV performs at the rate of most TV's that go for double the price. So if you buy this TV know that you will be disappointed in the Smart Hub feature but very surprised at the picture quality. Maybe the best you'll see for awhile. I give this TV a solid 8.5/10.....and I'm actually hard to please.Those calibrations that I promised:These calibrations were done professionally by the guys at lcdbuyingguide....(dotcom).

That in itself was an incredible achievement.Also interesting is the fact that Capote and his research assistant, Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird, never completed another serious work.

"While playing this game, you're given the choice of assassinating targets or eliminating them the ""moral"" ways.  The moral ways are absolutely disgusting and I have to wonder about the sanity of the people that wrote the script for this game.  Without going into spoilers (and anyone that wants spoilers can just google this), your choices are assassinate people or enslave and torture them until they die.  This is not the moral choice yet the game sets it up as the ""good"" way to deal with the people.  It's pretty sickening.The actual game play is divided up into stealth or run and gun.  I'm not a stealth person so I played it as a shooter/sword fighter.  This worked fine and the fighting is significantly better than The Last of Us which I was playing concurrently with it.  While the game is set up to allow for stealth or non-stealth playthroughs, the game repeatedly tells you that you're going to get the ""bad ending"" if you kill people.  They're basically penalizing people that don't enjoy stealth despite the claim that you can play it how you want.At the end of the day, this game is in no way a ""game of the year"".  It's average and the comparisons to Deus Ex are insulting because this is only marginally like it.  If you want to play a game that gives you choice, I highly recommend that.The game length for the main game is very short, maybe 12 hours long on the first time through it, probably could be done in 4 hours if you skip the cut scenes.  Of course if you play it the stealth route, your timer will say you finish the game in 10 or 12 hours but you'll have spent two hundred hours reloading your saves a billion times and on top of that you wouldn't be able to use 90% of the gameplay mechanics because while they want you to play the game using stealth, you have very few options available for that type of play (almost every weapon and power is geared towards run and gun).","12 21, 2013",This game's moral choices are disgusting,1387584000,VideoGames
"In order to avoid parallels to the common SATA II misnomer, the SATA-IO has compiled a set of marketing guidelines for the new specification. The specification should be called Serial ATA International Organization: Serial ATA Revision 3.0, and the technology itself is to be referred to as SATA 6 Gbit/s. A product using this standard should be called the SATA 6 Gbit/s [product name]. The terms SATA III or SATA 3.0, which are considered to cause confusion among consumers, must not be used. The standard was designed for SSDs but has been implemented for HDDs as well.Currently there's not much real world difference between SATA 3 and 6 for hard drives. SATA 6 was designed for SSDs but even those are not fast enough to take advantage of it yet.With 3.5in drives offering capacities exponentially higher than similarly-priced solid state counterparts, they're very far from dead. Considering the largest SSD size that's even remotely affordable is 256GB, those with lots of data will still want a magnetic hard drive. This drive can hold huge amounts of audio, video and picture data.If your computer only has a  SATA 3GB interface you can still use 6Gb drives so long as the cable is less than a meter (most are much shorter).The free Seagate DiskWizard software allows you to install 3TB and 4TB hard drives in Windows, including XP, without UEFI BIOS but I wouldn't recommend going that route.In my opinion unless you have a cutting edge system, with the  UEFI bios you may want to stick to smaller external drives as add-ons.","04 23, 2013",Seagate Desktop HDD 4 TB SATA 6Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive ST4000DM000,1366675200,Electronics

"I posted this review on the international version of this phone before the ATT version became available, but since my HTC One version is the ATT, I decided to post it here with a few modifications. I have also added pictures taken with the HTC One to the image gallery:2012 was the year of the smartphone for 3 big companies: Apple, Samsung and Google. The iphone 5 was about the best looking phone ever made with a solid operating system and excellent support. The Galaxy 3 stole the spotlight with terrific commercials and a solid contender with Apple. And Google released the best phone, in my humble opinion, ever made until that point. The nexus 4 was and is cheap for just $300, receives upgrades from google directly, and is quite simply a stunner. Last year, however, the HTC One X was also released if you didn't know, and it was second best only to the Nexus 4. It had a terrific screen, great build quality even though it was plastic, and it was just a thin slab of sexiness that slid into your pocket easily with the best camera of all phones mentioned above. Yet, nobody knew about it.This year, it seems people are hearing about HTC, and Apple and Samsung will have to fight one more company to take the spot of best smartphone. In my view they failed last year as google offered a phone that was for the first time the best mobile experience ever put on the palms of your hands.This year, the HTC One has taken that place from google. The HTC One is quite simply stunning in and out. First thing I did was put an invisible shield to prevent any scratches and keep its metal body ever intact (something I do to all my phones since I don't use a case, and more importantly, I never drop these guys).Design:Google took the experience from apple, but apple kept the design hat. This year HTC takes the design to a whole new level. No phone ever looked this good. It's just the right amount of heavy to make it solid, the right amount of curvature to sit on the palm of your hand, and the right amount of beauty and industrial design. The word Stunning can't be used enough here. The speakers are obviously for audio, but they simply add to the art in a way no other phone has done before. It's a work of industrial art that puts every iPhone model to shame.Experience:Matches the iPhone point by point and offers MORE. Home screens, Facebook integration, widgets, and a whole new home screen where you get news and all of your social information in one place. For those of you who use flipboard heavily as I do, it's the same great interface to give you just the right amount of news whenever you need it. As a news junkie, it's ever appreciated. If you don't need it, just ignore it to the side. But it doesn't hurt to have Facebook set up so you can easily see what's happening in your social circles. Within 1 minute of set up, I had close to 52GB of music available to stream and save from google play music (a free service BTW on every android phone), within 10 minutes I paid my bill at Duane Read using the phone as a wallet, and within 30 minutes I had taken the best shot I have ever taken with a mobile phone.The user interface for those who don't know is Sense. Sense 5? Maybe? It's fast, capable of handling widgets as well as google's unadulterated vanilla android on the Nexus 4, and is quite simple. But don't mistake that for a lack of options like the iPhone's simplicity. It is still android and all the options are there. It outdoes Samsung's touchwiz, and apple's outdated IOS which is obviously the same interface from 2007. I like this as much as the vanilla android on the nexus 4, and like it even more due to blinkfeed. The only thing I miss is the ability to add lockscreen apps, but that's coming soon (we hope).A good part of the user experience is UPDATES. Apple and google own this sector with outstanding updates. Google more so since their updates are actually useful. HTC plainly sucks. Here is hoping they will update the heck out of this phone, and force carriers, especially ATT to push out updates. Don't let this be another htc one x where we wait 7 months for a released update. If not, support carrier versions and push out updates themselves. Give me a link and let me download and install updates without my carrier. Or is that contractually not possible?Screen:Best screen on any phone. 1080P. It rules them all, and outdoes the HTC One X from last year. This is the whole phone experience, and having this kind of a screen just makes the phone a pleasure to use. Comparing this screen with the iPhone 5 just shows how much apple needs a larger screen more than ever. It is simply impossible for me to use my iphone after using the HTC One as you feel absolutely constrained when reading webpages, looking at pictures, etc. Puts last year's Samsung S3 to shame. It's quite a stark difference.Camera:The camera here is a fantastic shooter. Don't be alarmed at the 4MP factor. The images have terrific resolution, excellent color, and fantastic low light resolution. What worries most buyers is the detail presence due to 4MP, and if you're planning to print out huge posters, then this is not the camera to be used. If you want memories, at any time of the day, recorded with great clarity, then this camera offers the best balance between light resolution and detail possible right now (in a smartphone that is), especially if you have an active night life. The resolution and clarity of night pictures is just, again, Stunning.Speakers:I wasn't as blown away by the speakers as others were. They are the loudest speakers of any phone or tablet I've tried most certainly, but I'm waiting for the day when the backside of a phone will be a massive speaker that truly reproduces music similar to a stand alone speaker. But just for the advance in speaker and sound quality, this is another move in the right direction, much like the camera.Sound quality:The iPhone 4 and Nexus 4 to date have the best sound quality of any phone I've ever used (I hear the International S3 has a Wolfson Dac, but I never had the chance of trying it out, so no comments). The HTC One sounds quite similar to the IPhone 4 in sound quality and that is a great factor for audio aficionados. The HTC beats enhancement just doesn't cut it for me, so I installed my own EQ app to adjust as I pleased, and the sound is just the sweet spot of clarity and dynamic range. Capable of driving over the ear AudioTechnicas M50 very well. These are all subjective remarks, hopefully someone will be doing some actual measurements on the HTC One soon. But these remarks should put some people at ease. This phone is not google's nexus 7 tablet with its terrible, anemic sound quality. No need to worry about that here.Battery:Big enough for a day of work, but fails in comparison the upcoming S4 and Motorolla's droid razor max hd. It will provide enough juice to power through 13 hours of work. A full charge the night before, plus stand by and a whole day of work totals about 20 hours of continuous use. Install juice protector and enjoy your battery last longer.Conclusion:Outdoes every phone released in 2012 by a mile. Sexy, stunning design matched by a beautiful streamlined interface. It's perhaps corny to say this, since it's overly used, but this is the BEST phone I have ever used. I don't think apple will match it this year with the same design iPhone 5s that seems hollow and fragile when compared to the HTC One, and same old icon interface. Much the same, Samsung apears to have followed Apple's lead and released an S4 that deserves the title S3s, since it's more of a continuation of a well established brand. But the same cheap build quality continues in a trade off for removable battery and micro SD. Something Blackberry seems to have managed in a better fashion. Their phone accomplishes the same with a better build quality. The only company that seems to be hiding the game is google, and theirs may be the contender with the HTC One for title of best smartphone of 2013.The HTC One is missing a removable battery and a micro SD slot which they make up for by charging you $199 under contract for 32GB, instead of apple's outrageous $299. In my view, it doesn't detract from the experience one bit, just like it didn't from the Nexus 4. I feel quite comfortable using the HTC One as my only phone and have already passed most of my devices forward with the exception of the Nexus 4. And depending on google's move, if they don't include LTE this year, the Htc One will be the only phone I'll be using all year long. And gladly so. What a phone.Update 1: The 4MP camera on this phone has far surpassed my expectations. The photos look vibrant, the colors look realistic and the night shots are quite simply stunning. Check out some of the photos in the images section. I am also getting upwards of 13-20 hours of battery life on the HTC One, and have also posted screenshots of the power section to the gallery.Update 2: ATT versions of this phone are lagging behind the international versions in terms of software updates. International versions are being updated to 1.29, meanwhile ATT is still on 1.26. The newer firmware fixes camera problems with overexposure and improves image quality. It also fixes an intermittent issue with the home and back buttons not responding for some amount of time. Problems I'm facing daily, but that don't detract very much from the experience.  I will remove a star from this review depending on how long ATT takes to update these phones since it's their responsibility to update software. If you're facing unresponsive back and home buttons, simple shut your screen on and off and they'll resume operating correctly,","04 30, 2013",Best phone I have ever used,1367280000,CellPhone
"Did not anticipate it. The panel is definitely bright. Pulls lot of juice out of the battery. Tested it with multiple batteries. With 6 AA batteries it lasts 75 minutes. Same with the FP 550. I had a old FH70 Sony battery, I bought for my sony Camcorder 12 years back. Still works good. It lasts 90 minutes. I bought a new NP-F770, it lasts 120 minutes. All duration I have mentioned are before the light starts to fade. There is not indication of low battery. The 4 test LED, never lights up. Even with the new 770, fully charged, only 3 test LED lights up. So now, hardly couple of months old, one of the LED is dead, I think probably it might start to spread to other LED due to variation in power flow. The batter door is very flimsy. If you are not careful, you  might end up breaking it even when seeing first time. the hot shoe is not hot, it is actually cold. It is very hard to tighten and loosen, I always fear it might break. Else, light output is very good, I get good results during capturing video. Becomes slightly warm at the end of a hours usage. As this is my first one, I do not have anything to compare it with. But if this light goes bad, I may not buy it again. Will look into a different manufacturer. Need to contact support to see, if anything can be done for the broken LED.

"No fan is silent, but these come pretty close.  I bought this to replace a fan that came in my Wesena ITX1 HTPC case.  I thought that the Wesena fan would be junk, but it was actually pretty good and close to silent.  The thing I didn't like about it, though, is that it was barely moving any air.So, I tried the Noctua.  It was actually LOUDER than the Wesena fan, because the fan placement requires pushing air through a grille.  The fan placement is right up against the grill.  It was pushing so much extra air through this grill, that it become louder than the stock fan.  I see this as a good thing for the Noctua, because I couldn't tell from the noise how much extra air it was pushing when I had both fans outside of the case.  I can't blame the fan for the grille they put on the case.It isn't silent, and I did hear some tonal (non-whitenoise) sounds from it, especially while ramping voltage up and down on my power supply.

"Hard to beat for the price. And the chance to get both in a decent transfer is great, since before this Funny Farm, the funnier of the two, was only a pan and scan DVD.There are two types of Chevy Chase fans, ones that claim to be a fan and only like Vacation and Caddyshack, then there are ones who think Funny Farm is one of his quotable best, while also having a soft spot in their hearts for Modern Problems.Funny Farm has a better director than it deserves, but maybe that's why it's so unassuming and humble. Part of what makes it great. Better than all the Vacation sequels. If you ever wanted to trade city life for the country, this is a movie you will appreciate.Spies Like Us is also pretty damn funny, it gets a little too bogged down in trying to be a grand 007 spoof, and the training montage is terribly slapstick, but Chase has some choice lines. If you ever wanted to see Chevy Chase moonwalk, here is your chance. Boatloads of cameos. Frank Oz (a Landis staple), Terry Gilliam, Ray Harryhausen, Coen Bros, etc. It's easy to see how todays high concept comedies staring the likes of Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, Will Ferrel owe a lot to this movie and it's ilk.Both movies look decent, nothing surprising, soft like you expect, grain intact, no video noise or tinkering I can see,but Spies Like Us has pretty bad audio issues, very brittle sounding and re-occuring hiss.These films aren't Ghostbusters so they don't require pristine presentations, but they are still minor classics if you are a Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd, John Landis 80's comedy fans, so it's a little disappointing this is the best we'l ever get.Will there ever be a re-mastered version of either? So probably safe buying them hopefully for the last time. That is until 4k takes over, but even if that is sooner than Bluray took over DVD, these two titles are still a very long time away from looking better, these are deep-catalog titles.","02 20, 2014",Two Chevy Chase classics get barebones and borderline bad treatment.,1392854400,MovieTV

"Writer Kyle Killen and Director/actress Jodie Foster are two brave souls - to create a film about the serious psychological illness of Depression is a tough assignment alone, but to select as the star of this film the beleaguered sociopathic actor Mel Gibson whose appeal to audiences is at an all time low was an even testier decision.  The result of all of these preparatory decisions is that the film works - very well.  This may be the finest performance by Gibson on film and in many ways that is due to the faith and friendship of his defender and friend Jodie Foster.  Drop preconceived biases and see this rather extraordinary film: it will not leave your conscienceWalter Black (Mel Gibson) is a severely depressed new CEO-by-inheritance of a toy company, partnered by the wise and understanding Vice President (Cherry Jones).  He is unable to work at eh level expected and prefers to just stay in bed all day, escaping reality.  His wife Meredith (Jodie Foster) has tolerated his condition for too long and decides to leave him, taking their sons,  adolescent bright but insecure Porter (Anton Yelchin) and young Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) with her.  Walter drinks far too much and in his bleak despair unsuccessfully attempts suicide by hanging, stopped only by the communication of a Beaver hand puppet Walter found in the dumpster who remains on Walter's hand and speaks to Walter through Walter's voice (which sounds strangely similar to Michael Caine!).  With the at times comedic lines  and advice from Beaver, Walter gains the strength to re-enter the world: the Beaver is his alter ego and provides a line of demarcation between the real world and the one Walter simply cannot manage alone.  The Beaver allows him to become a valuable force in his business while allowing him to re-connect with Meredith - a closeness they have not had in years - but always through the voice of the Beaver.  The one person who cannot cope with the faade is  Porter - a lad who is making it through life by writing papers for fellow students and ultimately is asked to write the graduation speech for the beautiful but bruised Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) - opening another subplot about coming of age and dealing with emotional baggage on the part of both Porter and Norah.  How Walter finally deals with the Beaver who seems to be preventing him from living an honest existence ties all the fragile threads of this story together.Jodie Foster knows just how far to let each of her actors take their roles and in the end she has woven a tapestry about the tragedy of the diagnosis of depression  and its effect on a family that will be difficult to match.  Each of the actors gives razor sharp performances, but it is the baggage-laden Gibson who creates a character stronger than anything he has ever done before.  Life lessons learned? It doesn't matter.

"I haven't had this little sound system for very long, but so far it works great.  I charged it in the sun while laying out on the porch with a friend chatting and getting some color on our pasty white legs.  The sound was great outside and it was really convenient to be able to listen while it charged. I have a Bose docking station but I never feel comfortable carrying it around and plopping it outside while I am out there...it is small enough to be portable, but not really portable in a practical way.  Anyway, as I was laying there, I was glad that I could use the remote to switch the music because I had oil on me and didn't want to get the new thing greasy.  BUT THEN!!  I knocked over my ginormous glass of ice water, splashing A LOT of it on the Soultra.  It was unaffected.  VERY IMPRESSED. The input holes for the ac/dc adapter and headphones are protected under a well sealed rubber nubbin thing that offers them protection from moisture too.As for sound, I thought it had great sound, comparable to my Bose Docking Station...except my Bose doesn't allow me to adjust the bass. I have not tried it in the house to see if it compares to Bose' wave technology.  But overall, I really like this little guy.OH YEAH--my Bose remote gets lost for looong periods, usually only located during change of address relocations!  But the remote for this fits into a little cubby that is under the solar panel.  Very clever.  No more lost remote.Another reviewer noted that the sun burned up his iphone while using this. It seems pretty obvious to me that this product doesn't make your ipod or iphone bulletproof, and I would never have put my ipod in the direct sun for an extended period anyway.  So I positioned it so that the solar panels were in the direct sun, but the ipod was not.It isn't big, and easily carried to the beach or something.  As for packing it for a long trip...well it is an odd shape.  It would fit in my laptop bag...but then where would I put my laptop?  If I was checking luggage, no problem.  But if I was doing all carry-on (and skipping the ridiculous baggage charges) I would probably leave this at home.Highly recommend.***Have been using it in the house and the sound quality is really very good.  It does not, however, really compare to the Bose indoors.  I am not knocking this product, as it works very well and sounds really good.

So scary to think that there's that kind of evil in the world, but also so reaffirming that there are God-fearing people like the Warren's doing the Lord's good work. Oh, also the movie was well-done.THE NON-BELIEVER: Stupid, stupid, stupid. I can't believe these con artists are getting another movie made about their hucksterism. Wake up, people. The Warrens were awful people who preyed on the hopes of the ignorant and desperate. Oh, also the movie was pretty much like every other horror movie.THE HORROR LOVER: Horror movies are my guilty pleasure. I don't care what the story or budget was, I'll watch it. There are a lot of reasons for this, the primary one being that -- as rare as they are to find -- truly great horror movies can have an effect that lasts much longer than many dramas, comedies or shoot-em-ups. There's a vicarious thrill of survival that comes with an amazing horror film that makes you feel alive and appreciate the fragility of your own mortality. Because of this, I'll watch them all. Every single one.Of course, you can't watch that many horror movies without admitting that 95% of them are just plain awful. Laughable, usually. Maybe 0.09% of them are really great and memorable. The remaining 4.01% are somewhere in the middle, and that's where THE CONJURING falls on the scale.Is the movie well-done? Absolutely. There are strong performances (especially by some of the daughters), great cinematography and camera work, and fairly seamless special effects.Is the movie derivative? You bet. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of a single part of the film that is unique. You've got invisible spirits flinging people around. Pictures falling from walls. Creepy kids' voices. Ghosts appearing in flashes in mirrors. Strange bruises. Dogs that refuse to go in the house. A spooky basement. Witches. Corpses floating under water. There's even a creepy doll. For this, I'm afraid it loses major points. If you aren't the horror lover that I am and don't often watch scary films, you'll be suitably scared, I think. But seasoned viewers won't be seeing anything that they won't be able to predict pretty much every step of the way.Even this would warrant 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if it weren't for a few annoying plot contrivances that really took me out of the film. For instance, the Warrens constantly refer to God (Mrs. Warren is fond of explaining how God brought her and her husband together), but their religious beliefs feel tacked on, shallow, and meaningless. My favorite part? Mr. Warren, fearing for his wife's sanity and safety, suggests that he and her skip this particular spookfest and concentrate their energies on writing a book. Mrs. Warren's response? She scoffs and says with great disdain, ""I don't think God brought us together just to write a book."" Ha ha! Yeah. Since when has God ever wanted people to write a stupid book for Him?This kind of smugness in the characters is sporadic, but when it shows up, it is very distracting. Another example would be the fact that, for some reason, they keep totems from every exorcism and de-haunting in glass cases in their home. You'd think people this religious would, I don't know, swallow their pride and NOT keep previously possessed dolls in the same house they share with their young daughter. I'm no exorcist, though, so maybe that's a thing they do.Finally, I was bothered by the fact that the title of the film really has nothing to do with the story, as well as the fact that the credits show us actual photos of the Warrens and the family from the film, really trying to hammer home that all of this was (based on) REALITY. Considering the subject matter, it's a little unfortunate that they try to Blair-Witch it with the hazy line that exists between truth and fiction, and even more so that -- if this story IS true and the Warrens WERE doing God's work -- I really doubt God brought them together just to make a scary movie. Right, Mrs. Warren?Ha ha. Just kidding. I don't really care.","10 14, 2013","Based On A True Story About A Horror Movie!!!! (Also, Maybe God)",1381708800,MovieTV

"I bought this because of the rebate (and the card) and when I went to apply for the rebate, it says the offer for offer code EGA-12997 is only good from Oct 1 - 16th...I can't pick the 28th (when i placed my order)Is that the wrong code?Anyway,  the card rocks.  I, like AlexM, had a EVGA 260 Superclocked card, and while that card was awesome itself,  I needed something DX11, and faster (with my q6600, could only play BF3 at medium settings and at 1650x10-something).  Now, I'm going to need to get a faster processor, but I can at least play at very high settings and at 1920x1080...a vast improvement.  Card is relatively silent (i keep the side off my case for better airflow).  I've got it overclocked to 1000/2000/2200 with no major increase in heat (100Mhz jump from stock 900), and no artifacts.  All in all a great card for the money/free game, but I'm still ticked about the rebate.

"Disney continues its ""Fairies"" franchise with the latest entry in the series, ""Secret of the Wings."" This marks the fourth movie and there doesn't look to be an end in sight with next year's addition already scheduled. Timing couldn't be better to release the newest sequel since it takes place in the land of Winter and would make the perfect gift for Christmas for any little girl.A curious Tinker Bell ignores the rules of warm fairies and ventures into the forbidden world of winter. Her dangerous excursion leads her to uncover a mysterious secret and almost break a wing . A bizarre glow overcomes her wings during the quick visit, which drives Tinker Bell to return and delve deeper into the winter woods in search of the Keeper of all fairy knowledge.As is usual with Disney's Blu-ray releases, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks fabulous. Its CG animation is clean and picture perfect. A greater amount of visual depth can be felt when watching the 3D version of the film. However, the 2D version is stunning as well. The color schemes are beautiful no matter if the screen is filled with striking whites or darker tones.A 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees maximum audio enjoyment for viewers. The magical sounds of the fairy world, dialogue, and musical score really get a chance to make an impact on home theater audiences. As if there would ever be any question about Disney providing their loyal ""Fairy"" fans with a high quality audio experience.Special features include a bonus 22-minute adventure entitled ""Pixie Hollow Games."" It also contains two music videos by McClain Sisters and Zendaya. There's a never-before-seen preview of ""Fright Light"" and deleted scenes with introductions by the filmmaker as well.The ""Secret of the Wings"" 4-disc combo pack gives Disney collectors every possible format for people to view the movie in. There's a regular DVD, a digital copy to watch on the go, and 2D and 3D Blu-ray versions. It's a great addition to any ""Fairies"" enthusiast's home entertainment library.","11 1, 2012","Blu-ray Review: ""Secret of the Wings""",1351728000,MovieTV

"This is my first negative review of product that offers outstanding hardware. I bought this camera looking to expand upon the two rooms covered by my Foscam cameras. Overall I have been satisfied with my Foscam cameras, but was looking to expand beyond 720p resolution to 1080p offered by the Dropcam and have experienced some issues with the Foscam FW8921 model needing to frequently be restarted for the video feed to resume. The Dropcam Pro excelled in nearly every way over the Foscam with exception of one fatal flaw.PROs:*Fantastic aluminum build quality. Sleek and minimalistic design.*Setting port forwarding protocol through a router necessary to connect to the Foscam camera when away from home is a challenge. Setting up the Dropcam was a breeze, requiring only an IOS device and can be accomplished by anyone regardless of technological literacy.*Video quality both day and night are excellent. I was expecting the Dropcam Pro to provide a better picture offering more megapixels and full HD 1080p resolution in contrast to the 720p Foscam, but was still surprised at how much more clear the resolution appears.*Although the Dropcam does not feature pan and tilt, the wide field of view essentially eliminates the need of such feature.*There will be a video delay when viewing video broadcast from any Wi-Fi/IP camera. What is impressive about the Dropcam is it produces no longer delay than my Foscam cameras despite broadcasting in higher resolution and able to provide noticeable better frame rate at 1080p than the Foscam at 720p.CONs:*In order to capture a wide field of view the image does have a fisheye effect very similar to the video captured with action cameras.*Foscam and virtually all other IP cameras allow you to easily capture and record video or pictures either manually or setting up motion detection directly on your camera via an SD card, to your computer, or smartphone/tablet.  The only way Dropcam allows videos to be stored is through their cloud based storage. You will receive a short free trial then you get to add another recurring bill to your phone, internet, cable...etc bills, necessary to use this camera for any more than live (delayed) viewing. Additionally, Dropcam has done a good job at preventing customers implementing workarounds from paying for their cloud storage.Overall:$200 is a reasonable price for the build, image and overall performance quality this camera offers. Unfortunately, Dropcams efforts to keep cashing in on the product after the initial purchase is a horrendous approach taking advantage of customers and the reason mine was returned. Dropcam should entice consumers to use their cloud based storage through features such as superior application and website playback design not mandate in order to provide continued use of a product you purchased unsubsidized. The company intentionally prevents any means to record video through any method besides their cloud storage. Without paying the recurring fees the camera becomes practically useless. The delay in video and audio when viewing ""live"" makes it a poor choice as a baby monitor and without paying for recording capability it offers no surveillance value. I would strongly recommend waiting for Samsung to release their Smartcam HD model expected in March for $179 which match the features and design of Dropcam while adding local onboard storage eliminating privacy concerns and extra fees beyond initial price with the possible exception of an SD card. Hope this review is helpful. I provided all the highlights of the this product rather than simply complaining about my reason for returning for others to make an informed decision before purchasing. I am sure some will not mind the required recurring fee, but I feel the majority would choose otherwise if aware other options exists without the continued extra fees.*UPDATE*I have had 2 days to play around with the Samsung Smartcam HD and can gladly say so far it lives up to expectations combining the best of Foscam features with the top notch hardware of the Dropcam. The build quality of the Dropcam reigns supreme, like comparing Samsung Galaxy to an iPhone, but everything else is on par if not better with the Smartcam. Setup is just as simple on the Smartcam HD while offering the advantage of having the ability to setup straight from your Android phone or tablet in addition to iOS device. Load time to pull up the image on both cameras website and applications are nearly the same. Both cameras occasionally fail when attempting to connect from the Android app requiring a 2nd attempt. There is no clear winner in image quality with both offering nearly the same wide field of view, but somehow the Smartcam does so without as much of a fisheye effect. The mic and speaker on the Samsung are notably better. The Smartcam HD utilizes your Gmail account to send event (motion detection) notifications immediately to your phone and Picasa for snapshots of events, whereas the Micro SD slot is used to store video recordings. So if your worried about an intruder simply stealing the camera and all your evidence, then you will be relieved to have access of the free cloud storage of that photo of them taking the camera. Sure your limited to 1GB of free space on Picasa, but that stores a whole lot of images which are easy to delete straight from the Smartcam App. Unless you really need to have constant video recording being done, the Samsung Smartcam HD is a much better value that only increases as time passes and no furture bills become due. I plan on putting up a full review of the Smartcam HD once I have more time testing it out.","02 16, 2014",Great wi-fi camera trying to trap you into monthly payments,1392508800,Electronics

"Update 2/12/2014I have to admit that I wrote a wrong review for this product. My little boy drop the iPad mini with Retina only once from less than 2 ft heigh and the screen shattered.I don't blame this case. It is really a decent nice case for iPad mini WITHOUT Retina. But I had successfully put in the mini w/Retina into this case and THOUGHT it's protected. But since mini w/R is just a little thicker than previous generation, the screen will NOT be flat with the edge of this case, which leaving the screen more easy to hit the floor if it drops.I paid for this lesson with $268.92 (incl.TAX) to exchange with a new mini w/R in Apple Store. They don't repair the screen but just do the exchange. Or if you have bought AppleCare, they will cover two accident damage of the screen with $49 (excl. TAX) for each incident.So DO NOT BUY this case if you have a mini w/Retina. Speck has made case for mini w/R now.11/14/2013I just got my iPad mini with Retina yesterday and got this fantastic case today. I would say this is just the perfect case built with quality and it looks so cute. Snug fit, the cover can wake up/turn off the screen, and the plastic snap makes it secure enough to carry around.If I'm picky enough that the only complain is iPad mini with Retina display is just a little bit thicker than the old iPad mini. It can still fit in this case nicely, but need a little patience and technique to push it in.","11 14, 2013",Well built and cute case for iPad mini with Retina,1384387200,Electronics

"Upon purchasing both consoles after launch, I decided I only wanted one, especially for now. But wanted to do an in depth test of both.The Xbox One while clever with it's voice activated technology, via the kinect was just getting old. And I felt myself wanting to just pick up the controller and use it. Also it felt very dated, or 2002 as I like to say, very large in design, and just an over all unrefined feel. The PS4 on the other hand seems more polished and smooth, both in it's design, interface and overall performance. That's not to say that Xbox One game perform poorly, but I can honestly say the 50% GPU boost does improve not only graphics, but the overall ""feel"" of the gameplay. Certain games on the Xbox One seems to ""struggle"" a bit even on the simplest of games. When it comes to downloads they are about the same. For instance on the PS4 I got the online gamecode for Knack since it's much cheaper, saw it was a 35gb file and downloaded it in less then two hours. It really takes advantage of my 50mb connection with boosts up to 70mb. Which also make online gaming quite a treat, along with any extensive updates.So here is the basic rundown of both systems and why I chose PS4, which was pretty obvious to me after the initial purchases about 2 weeks apart.PS4 ProsMust more refined, design, interface etc.Sharper graphics, even the home screen is much much clearer50% more power is just that, and makes a difference in gaming performance overall, not just graphicsThe small speaker feature on the controller is actually cool.Doesn't use a lot of gimmicks to get it's point across100$ cheaper, better exclusives in the future. And remember nothing beats Sony Exclusives, never have never will.Smaller, quiet, runs hot, but nothing alarming.Much faster response on the home screen, no lag, boots up much faster.Cons-Not manyThe PSN (store) seems to disappear from time to time and just give a blue screen. Nothing major, just hibernate, bring it back up, and it stays. Just a strange glitch.The controller is good, but I will admit i think the Xbox controller (even on 360) has a bigger, more controlled feel.Mixed feelings about the new Playstation Now, since I'll never get rid of my PS3, for all my multimedia. And backlog of games. Also I won't need to play old games much.No MP3 streaming or playback from a USB Flashdrive device (yet).Xbox One ProsThe Kinect when it works, but this feature is a gimmick and got/will get old with time.The controllerA few games (more) from launch and recently that are not on PS4. Nothing spectacular though.Xbox Cons-Hence why I didn't go with it.Big, bulky, the power brick, looks like a 1977 beta player. May help keep it cooler, that's about it.Games feel bogged down, even the simple ones. Some games have framerate drops, and shouldn't.Interface it ok, but feels very convoluted, messy, and needs a lot of fine tuning.Poor sales, reviews, no promotion, and overall hate for the system doesn't really make you want to keep it.I feel at this point in technologies era, everything should be full 1080p or close, and have the latest hardware. Xbox One doesn't.Having to pay for apps you're already paying for via Xbox Live is robbery, IMO. Netflix being the most popular.Not nearly as many exclusives as PS4 will have. You can do a lot more with games like Uncharted, a next gen The Last Of Us, God Of War, Motorstorm etc. Than you can with Halo and Gears of Bore.So that's basically it, I feel that IMO the PS4 is superior, and the Xbox One is inferior. And it should be a good creative balance, which to me it is not, with the Xbox lagging behind in every way. I'm a 38 year old man btw, not some fanboy, or young teen defending my product so all of my friends will think I'm the man. I have worked on computers for years, built gaming rigs, so I prefer quality, and quantity. And I know great technology when I see it. And even though there isn't a lot happening right now, the PS4 flies off shelves faster than any console I've ever seen, and this is starting from Atari back in 1978, when I was about 3. I don't hate the Xbox, but I feel it wasn't promoted, or built with the future in mind, for gamers. Only for multimedia living rooms where people can take advantage of it. Also Sony is certainly known for it's great reliability, and has been around for nearly 60 years. So as I said not really many questions left to ask as to why I chose it.","11 16, 2013",Why I Ultimately Chose The PS4,1384560000,Electronics
"Hats off to Dominic Purcell for a great job at playing a smoldering loser who finally loses it.  However, there are more plot holes in this movie than you could fill with a ton of joint compound.  This guy is a veteran, OK, and he just happened to take with him after discharge his M4?  He is an armored car driver in New York,obviously subject to a background and criminal record check, but he has an illegal military assault rifle that he took from his military days?

"The game is NOT BAD However the game is no essentially good either. I don't know what it is about it but the game just seems a little ""off.""  Everything in the game is smooth except for the driving, which makes the cars feel like weighed tanks except when you go around a corner and spin out of control.  Theirs a decent amount of cars/bikes/boats in the game.  Story is good  Ton's of stuff to do.Ubisoft severs are either always down or no one is in multiplayer because the game can never find other players.  Would be fun if Ubisoft worked on it a little.Finally I noticed multiple times lag within gameplay.  When you finish a mission and you start to run or drive the game lags.  When your in the cut scenes and a character grabs an arm of another the hand goes right through the arm.  This is what I am irritated the most with. Ubisoft delayed the game to polish it, which is absolutely fine but if you delayed a game for this long please make sure simply lags and cut scenes are on point.  I will get use to the horrible driving but that lag needs to be fixed.UPDATE:So after playing some more, I noticed that the game is completely laggy and is full of glitches.  I was standing right by enemies and they didn't advanced because of the ""glitch"" that must have been going on.  I noticed this with each activity, side quest, etc.  I already mentioned this but I still don't understand why Ubisoft delayed the game to polish it yet theres still a lot of errors/bugs/glitches that need to be worked out.

"**Would rate this as 4.5/5 if I could**A bit of background...I had a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 that I purchased in March over the Asus Prime because of all the WiFi and GPS issues it was having. But at the bottom of my heart I still wanted one of these becauseof the hardware (quad core, micro SD slot, screen resolution). As luck would have it a friend was interested in buying the Samsung so I took the opportunity to finally get my hands on the TF700.After a month or so with the tablet...I have to say that I am very happy with the experience overall. I had read a lot of reviews so knew what to expect going in. I did return the first one I received due to signifinant light bleed but the return was painless and the second one was almost perfect except for slight screen lift on the bottom left corner, which is considered normal according to Amazon 2nd tier customer support (but they said if it causes any problems they will honor a return since I have it noted on file).So far have no major complaints other than having to get used to the battery life (had been spoilt going 5 days before having to charge now its abut 3 days!). Software updates have been so much faster than Samsung...currently waiting for 4.2 update. I am experiencing an issue that has been reported with 4.1 Jelly Bean on these devices which is that with the new screen refresh rate some of the apps have an occasional black line flicker across the screen.I am really enjoying reading news on the New York Times and BBC apps, and slowly transitioning from hard copies to reading books on the Kindle app. I'm not going to say much about the screen other than the fact it makes watching videos and movies an awesome experience.

Maybe they can improve the product with a better wire cover and put a rubber in the bottom, because the charger sometimes falls from the desk when you remove your phone from the charger.","03 19, 2014",Very Good QI Charger,1395187200,CellPhone

"I find these to be well suited to very well suited to VOIP/skype use, and listening to background music at work. They are comfortable to wear for long stretches, and have good sound quality - and it's obvious Sennheiser spent the money where it counts - on the headphone drivers and the noise-canceling microphone.  Still, you can tell there has been some obvious cost-cutting going on in the way the headband was constructed, similar to the way that many modern car dashboards look nice but feel cheap.  While the headband doesn't feel flimsy in a way that it might break after repeated use, it certianly don't have the hefty feel of a product like an iPhone, either.  On the other hand, this kind of construction is one of the reasons that the headphones are so light on the head - except for the pressure holding them on, you almost forget that you are wearing them.If you equate ""high touch"" with quality, you might be happier with the purchase of a more expensive Sennheiser model, or perhaps a Logitech unit.  If not, there's little reason not to recommend these headphones, as they do a great job for what they were designed.","12 13, 2011","Practical, but not for the gadget geek.",1323734400,Electronics

"I have owned this album ever since its release in 1976. Nobody else had it but me, and it was cool. So different at the time, very progressive, such diverse and spectacular music. This was the earliest album I've heard containing guitar synthesizer. Like other ground breaking artists at the time such as Pink Floyd and Camel, this band found their niche. The only problem was they did not catch the breaks. What a shame, a very talented group. indeed.Over 30 years later, I'm still playing this baby, and cranking it for all its worth. I especially enjoy ""Modane Train"" as the song just builds and builds like a runaway train it takes off. This sucker brings back memories.The cover art is amazing, very trippy for the time period which adds to it's appeal.Another reviewer noted...""Timo Laine helps give this a very dark and ominous presence at times, and there are some very original and unique sounds happening here.Keyboard player, David Stone is an incredibly talented player in his own right, and is classically trained. He went on to replace Tony Carey in 'Rithcie Blackmore's Rainbow'. Hard to believe this is the same guy that later played on 'Rainbow' classics like 'Long Live Rock and Roll' and 'Kill the King', but it's really him!""As Timo explains...""What 360 Systems had done was invent a device called a Pitch to Voltage convertor. The convertor was hooked up to a hexiphonic pick-up allowing it to be sent to a synthesizers.Bob Easton had the prototype sitting on his work bench, it was hooked up to six Oberhiems. I fired it up and Bam!, I fell in love.I made a deal with Bob immediately, and at a price of $10,000 he sold it to me. I had it shipped to Canada where I was in pre-production for my first Symphonic Slam album. This system was a great tracking unit because it was polyphonic. There was no harmonic problems like the later developed monophonic systems that never worked or tracked well.This was a high performance moon rocket that responded perfectly to my style.Since I used the system on every song on that album, the word got out real fast about this monster guitar rig. To my good luck A&M; Records released the album world wide off the starting blocks.""It's all Dutch to me, but reading between the lines you can tell that this guy was an experimentalist, a pioneer. And the end result is worth a listen.For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Symphonic Slam's ""self titled"" on You Tube.","11 6, 2012",360 systems polyphonic guitar synthesizer...I Like It ! !,1352160000,CDVinyl
"This is absolutely one of the very best ever made about the holocaust. Blending rarely seen archive footage, still photos, and meticulous re-creations using German actors, this film tells the story of the holocaust and Auschwitz like no other film ever has. Each dramatic sequence is constructed from SS records, diaries, and witness accounts, all blended together to tell the most accurate and complete story of what really happened, and how the death camps were constructed and used. And with the use of historical re-creations of plans implemented to construct death factories efficient enough to be capable of killing millions. This Documentary is laid out in six segments, each followed by in depth educational discussions with experts on the subject of the holocaust. Absolutely the most riveting and revieling study ever done on the Nazi's and the holocaust.

"I have been using 2 wifi networks in my house to cover all areas of my home. The ATT Uverse router was installed on one end of my house and wouldn't reach the other end of the house. So I installed an Airport Express from around 2005 via ethernet wire at the other end of my house. The problem with this setup is that my iPhone and iPads would not automatically change over to the stronger signal network. So I would have to change over networks manually every time I went back and forth in my house. This became very old very fast.So I ordered this latest version of the airport extreme September 2012. I couldn't be happier with it! I turned off the Uverse wireless, unplugged the old Airport Express and installed this Airport Extreme in a central location in my home.

"I purchased this after running out of battery at work several times. It came a day late and the Anker's box was opened. The device had been clearly returned, it had finger prints all over the sides but only the plastic cover on the top had scratches. (The plastic peels away)My personal experience was not that great, it was too bulky to replace a small USB charger BUT if you are a college student, I would highly recommend it. You could slip it into your backpack and be able to charge in class or on the go.The device did not fill the void I hoped it would. I ended up returning it after the price dropped 20% right after buying it. However, I gave the battery 4 stars because it does hold a considerable charge and does come with a lot of connectors. The build quality seems decent, but the silver band feels a little tacky in my opinion. I took one star off not only because it was clearly used and returned, but because the manual says to not leave devices connected after they are finished charging since the charge circuit may not shut off, causing damage. Even if modern electronics such as phones have overcharge protection, I am not willing to take the risk.Overall, this would be great for the college student, hiker, or someone who isn't near outlets all day. I though it would be useful for me but I am rarely far away from a power source. For $49, it is a decent buy.Edit: After the 20% price drop, I reconsidered purchasing it. Coming from an electronics background, I know a 10,000 mAh battery would be fairly large and expensive. Since this battery is $49, including the charge circuit, case, connectors, and such, the battery is most likely a 3.7v, low discharge rate cell that is being boosted to 5, 9, and 12 volts though a special circuit. In other words, although they advertise 10,000 mAh, it will be less because a lot of that is used up being converted to a voltage, plus the lose involved from the conversion it self. I did not take a star off because I do not have the battery to rip it apart and test it, but it is something the buyer should be aware of. Just because it says 10,000mAh, do not expect it to charge you 1000mAh phone ten times! It will be a lot less due to the way they market the device.","11 24, 2012","Not very useful for me, some marketing gimmicks",1353715200,Electronics

"This seems to be a pretty neat device that would work fantastic for anyone living within 20 miles of station towers. The stations within that range of my house come in crystal clear. However, the stations that are about 46 miles away, which in my case are the major networks and the only ones I really cared about, do not come in at all. The reason I give this only 2 stars is because of the false pretenses I bought this on. According to Mohu's website, I should be getting all of the channels I need in HD based on proximity to my ZIP code. I've tried every room and I'm not in an area that has allot of interference at all. I don't get even a hint of a signal past 20 miles away and I have the Ultimate model. So more or less, this antenna is useless to me and I will never use it. Waste of money in my case. If you live close to stations, it may work great for you. However, if you don't, do not trust the results the website gives you when you check available channels in your ZIP code. Cut your expectations in half. And this also raises the question, if you live close, do you really even need the Ultimate model?

"Ten CC has ben called ""too clever by half"" by certain members of the critcal press in their long history. They are clever. Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman weathered the loss of Godley and Creme and made an album filled with intricate songs performed well. The only exceptions IMHO were the two hits, ""People in Love"" and ""The Things We Do For Love"". People who purchase the CD for those two hits will be disappointed by the rest of it. I LOVE this album in spite of, not because of, the succesful tracks. I am a long time Ten CC fan that did not see pablum pop coming out them. The rest of the CD is almost flawless. From the opener ""Good Morning Judge"" about a hapless souls habit of finding himself before a magistrate, to the angst of ""Modern Man Blues"" , the amusing, clever and educational ""I Bought A Flat Guitar Tutor"" to the seminal original closing track ""Feel The Benefit (Parts 1,2 and 3). A trip through varied time signatures and styles ending in one of my favorite guitar solos. Seriously, the solo is a case study in how to build and excite and leave them wanting more. Highly recommended for Ten CC fans. Recommended for anyone expanding their musical horizons. Not recommended if all you want are the two hits. On second thought.

"Read the bottom for the final update that changed the review from 5 stars to 2.So let me first start off by saying this. Never, never buy a flat screen tv online. They usually do not have the same warranties that in stores do. I usually always buy off Amazon and other online avenues, but I know tv's like these can bite the dust at anytime. I bought mine at Costco because this tv comes with a 2 year warranty and with a 3 year additional warranty for just $30. So I ended up buying this tv for less and have a 5 year warranty. These warranties usually apply at most warehouse and department stores.Now, on to the actual tv review. I've had this tv for a couple weeks and I have been very pleased. The Neflix app is amazing and comes in HD (1080) (which I note because if you are currently using your Playstation (720) or Wii (480) this does not appear in HD). The menus and functionality are awesome too. Oh, and the sound is great too. The sound really packs a punch for such a razor thin tv. Paired with the the HD package I have with my cable company this is just pure heaven while watching tv. I'm giving this a very fair 5 out of 5 because it deserves it.Again, I do recommend this TV whole heartedly, but please be smart and buy any TV at a reputable vendor that offers a really good warranty. These newer TV's are great but they are notorious for biting the dust. Amazon may be the cheapest but their warranties don't go far. Save yourself the heartbreak later and buy the warranty, and make sure the warranty is backed by a good retailer.Warranty + This particular TV = Awesome Sauce*******UPDATE*******So I actually was so impressed with my 370sl (37"") model that I actually talked my wife into letting me buy the 470sl model (47""). Both models are superb. The picture is amazing and the apps are awesome. Plus both these models are very affordable (I bought both at Costco due to their awesome warranties and return policies) I fully recommend both these models. Oh and by the way, no I am not a fake review by some ad agency. I too hate it when bogus reviews falsely praise crappy products, but you can rest assured that these two tvs (370sl and 470sl) completely are legit. Just in case though, always check reviewers by their past reviews. Hope this helps anyone. Cheers!******FINAL Update****Sadly after buying both the 370sl and 470sl models both had a flaw that made me cringe. Both the models volume controls crap the bed. I loved both these tv's because they had the very best picture available in my opinion. My 37"" volume started going up and down during programs, mainly during apps like Netflix. Then it started happening to the other one. Then it started happening while watching cable. I did some research and found out that it is kind of common with these models. I'm really bummed because I thought these tv's were amazing. After working with Vizio on the phone with a firmware update they said they could send someone out. I declined due to the fact that I had already read 3 reviews where this had been a problem and even the techs were unable to fix it. I decided that maybe these were a bad omen of things to come. I returned both tv's and bought a higher priced Samsung. After making the switch I now know why Samsung has a higher price tag. Samsung far surpasses Vizio in every way, except apps. The apps on Vizio can't be beat. Vizio's interface is ultra fast processing apps. I'd say the apps are Vizio's best selling point. I don't want to get into comparisons between Samsung and Vizio, because I don't feel people read these reviews to hear about other products. Also, I think Vizio is a great company and I don't want to bash on them. Sometimes these things happen. In my case it happened twice.In conclusion, I would do some research on these models. I found that this specific model has had the same problems with fluctuating volumes. The rep at Costco also said that I was not the first person to return these model tv's with the same problem. I hope anyone that buys this has better luck than I did. I love Vizio. I have owned 4, not including these and been extremely happy. Anyways, hope you can see how things started great with these tv's but soon went down hill. Oh well, I'm happy with my Samsung.......for now. I'm giving this tv 2 stars and not one because it is unfortunate that such a great tv, with great apps and picture quality, had to have such a flaw. Anyone else run into this?","05 6, 2012","Changed from a 5 star to a 2 star. FOR 37"" & 47"" ONLY",1336262400,Electronics

"I got this flash for my Canon EOS M. It works well with the TTL-II system of the EOS M. However, I was disappointed to see that it did not allow any manual mode flash operation on the camera. It can be tilted up to bounce flash from low ceilings to get a better flash picture indoors. I found that the bounce flash in the TTL mode was a bit underpowered. Turning up the EV compensation on the flash resulted in much better bounce flash pictures. If you want to use a flash in TTL mode on Canon cameras, it is a good choice.

"It's hard to believe that Perahia's set of Beethoven concertos with Haitink and the Concertgebouw is now a quarter of a century old.  It was done in the fairly early digital days, and the sound still seems about as good as it could be, with plenty of presence from the orchestra, even while the piano part comes through as clear as a bell.  By the time he came to record with Perahia, Haitink had already provided excellent support for Alfred Brendel and Claudio Arrau in these concertos (both for Philips, in the '70's and '60's respectively) -- now here he is in the mid-1980's with another great pianist.  Other reviewers have commented more specifically on the individual concertos, and I agree with their judgments.  In general, one can't help but admire the clarity of the playing, the beauty of Perahia's tonal palette, the dynamic control, and the firm rhythmic grip that both pianist and conductor exhibit without ever seeming driven or relentless.  And as I said earlier -- the sound is just great.  The analogue sound that Philips gave Brendel still comes up well; Arrau's sound shows its age just a little more, and so for audiophiles Perahia may be the best choice (although a recent set from Goode and Ivan Fischer is also lovely).  But really, you need all these if you can afford 'em -- and throw in Kovacevich/Davis as well.","11 27, 2012",an excellent set from a great pianist and musician,1353974400,CDVinyl
"This Blu-Ray is cheap, has a decent feature set, and is a name brand so like many, I jumped on it when it was on sale at amazon for $65 after instant rebate.  Installed it on our bedroom tv (a Samsung plasma) and upgraded the firmware.  Upon reboot, it was frozen.  I couldn't get it out of this, including unplugging it.  I figured it was just an issue with the firmware update and didn't worry to much about it.  Panasonic support got me back up and running (remove ALL cables, then plug back in just the power cable).Well, I quickly realized this is not the player to get unless you want to get daily phone calls from your wife while you're at work asking why Lion King or Finding Nemo (for my daughter) won't play on the bedroom tv.  It freezed up in the above mentioned way about every 1/3 time we put a movie in.  Blu-Ray, DVD, didn't matter.  Anyway, eventually I got fed up with it and returned it.

"Somehow I managed to miss this 1996 film until now.  It is certainly one of the best modern westerns to come along.  Chris Cooper heads an excellent cast, playing the son of a legendary sheriff of a Texas border county.  He himself is now the sheriff, but had issues with his father while growing up.  Writer/director/editor John Sayles does brilliant work with the screenplay, salted with interesting characters.  The skeletal remains of a man are found in an old rifle range and Cooper's character begins an investigation.  Sayles' story turns up more figurative skeletons as the story develops.  I was also impressed with Elizabeth Pena who I'd only seen in stereotyped work before.  She's brilliant here.  Sayles most impressive component of this film is how he manages the scene changes from the current time to the flashback setting.  Slow camera pans make it easy for the audience to follow the story.  A controversial ending to be sure, but it works for me.","03 29, 2012",4 1/2 stars for a masterful western,1332979200,MovieTV

"As a Les Misaholic I was so excited to hear PBS would be again broadcasting this concert. Eagerly I tuned in but in the end I was left highly disappointed. The cast of 1995's special truly was the ""dream"" cast and with reason. Colm Wilkinson is without a doubt the best ValJean in the show's history, his chemistry with Phillip Quast is unmatched. It was so great to see Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway back as ""the T's"" though. Many slammed their performance from 95 but I found it most enjoyable, providing the comic relief these characters are. Lea Salonga, what can I say? First off, I LOVE Lea, but to cast her as Fantine was a bad call. Lea is without a doubt most the most well known and the best Eponine and to take her away from that role, I just don't know. Ruthie Henshall is the best Fantine (sorry to the Patti LuPone fans). And now to Nick Jonas, were producers thinking this was the only way they could sell tickets? Yes he looks the part of Marius but he can't hold a candle to Michael Ball (""Empty Chairs"" is a prime example).

"""Never judge a book by its cover"", they say. That is all very well and oh so wise, but buying a cd because you like its cover can be a thrill.This is what we did with ""Lumiere"" by Dustin O'Halloran. The disc had been stalking us anyway, we kept noticing it in every record shop we happened to go to...We have no regrets whatsoever. ""Lumiere"" is an extremely accomplished instrumental work of classically-inflected music, one that anyone with even a passing interest in the seven notes should not miss for any reason.Its first striking feature is the wonderful interplay between Mr O'Halloran piano playing and the silken poise of the Acme string quartet, a trait that will conquer you as soon as the first track starts to work its charms.There are other instruments too: guitar, celeste and analogue synth accompany the gracefully pensive strings and form a droning texture, over which the fragrant, wistful melodies flow effortlessly.You may have guessed it by now, but ""Lumiere"" is no cocktail music. The light we are talking about here is of the twilight variety, a sigh gliding through a wood-panelled room at the end of the day.There is melancholy. Regret. Repressed desire. There is human life. If you need musical references think Wim Mertens, Dakota Suite, Bowie's ""Low"" (side 2), or an instrumental version of Tindersticks and The Blue Nile.Mr O'Halloran may have been one half of the Devics, but with this record he has bridged the gap between classical and popular with extreme ease and superior compositional skill.Choosing highlights is obviously very difficult. Try ""Fragile"", with its heartbreaking piano motif that will leave you gasping for more. Or ""Snow And Light"", a piece flowing on single notes that could be a fitting continuation of Bowie's ""Subterraneans"". Try the whole cd, actually.""Lumiere"" is music destined to last.

"WWE likes to spin history their way, and they do when it comes to covering how the AWA lost ground to WWE, but they also address the facts. Verne Gagne, for all his marvelous achievements as an athlete, Marine, student, amateur and pro wrestler, and promoter, simply did not use the dynamite he had in Hulk Hogan. He missed the boat in the 1980s and never recovered. With that said, this DVD is loaded with great matches, some not viewable anywhere else (Except the WWE Network), and the documentary itself is a who's who of old school pro wrestling. The Gagnes really did train just about everybody you've heard of from the 1970s-1990s.

"****UPDATES BELOW****This is an interim rating considering the benefit of the doubt.  I have been burned a few times already by Linksys/Cisco routers, and I was hoping that they had gotten their act together. My first was a 54G which sufficed until it started getting a little flaky and unreliable ... also slow because of the additional devices (tablet, two smart phones, etc.)  So I upgraded to a N300 which was a nightmare to set up and very slow because of the single channel.  In addition, the signal strength was absolutely useless.  I live in a ranch style house and it was almost impossible to get a strong signal at the other end of the house.  When my wife and I used it simultaneously, I would have been better off with tin cans on a string.Enter the E2500:The setup was a breeze, two Android smartphones, an HP AIO wireless printer, a Kindle Fire, and a guest network in addition. The signal strength doesn't appear to have changed very much, but the dual band operation enables much better multiplexing of traffic, so it seems faster ... I don't know yet whether I will need a range extender.  I'm hoping not.Guidance:  Use the setup disk. It works like a charm.  Also, use the guest network option with a password so proximity users don't jump on your net and eat up your bandwidth.I'll have to give it some time, so tonight when we are both watching Jeopardy and playing WWF and Candy Crush on our own devices, we'll see just how well it works. I will not hesitate to upgrade this to 5 stars, or downgrade it if need be.****UPDATE 11/13/2013****I have downgraded this router to three stars for one simple reason.  It performs no better than my older N300 single channel Linksys router in terms of range.  I should have known better having been in network development for the last 40 years of my career.  The throughput appears to be better because of the dual channel, but the signal strength is the same - abysmal.  I will most likely have to purchase a range extender to get decent reception at the other end of my 2400 square foot home - max end to end distance is about 45 feet through three walls.  Not a great distance, and I am a little annoyed that Cisco has not improved upon this.****Update 11/21/2013****I received a question from an Amazon customer asking whether this router had a USB port.  I looked at the picture on the product page, and sure enough, it showed a USB port to the left of the Ethernet ports.  I don't need the USB port so it doesn't really bother me, but it appears that Cisco is using the same photo for a group of related products.  At the end of the product page there is a matrix showing the features and the E2500 does NOT have a USB port and it is clearly stated.  So there is a discrepancy between the different pieces of data on the product port. If you want a USB port you will have to move up to a more expensive device.This all said, I did purchase a range extender (as I thought I might in my update of 11/13/2013) RE2000.  This is a dual band range extender and is designed to work with this series of routers.  It works beautifully and gives me four wireless arc signal strength throughout my home.  There is an issue with the RE2000 though since there is a faulty firmware chip which has to be upgraded before it will work.  Read my review on the RE2000.  I even give you Cisco/Linksys Home support number ... and they were very competent.  They know the problem --- you won't be the first person they have spoken to.","11 12, 2013","DOWNGRADE UPDATE FOLLOWS - Easy setup, seems to be working well, ... time will tell more",1384214400,Electronics

"I really wanted this to work. The problem is that the wiring is at best 26 gauge and the connectors are too flimsy to be reliable. If you plug in or unplug the usb male into the power jack the shield slides right off. The 3.5mm connection is almost hair thin and provides no practical reliability. I sent it back after a week.If only the device had come with jacks that allowed me to upgrade to better cabling I would have loved it. Instead I found a similar ""puck"" with 3.5mm and mini-usb connectors. The cables that came with it impressive, and I can replace them if I need to in the future.UPDATE - The manufacturer contacted me directly (when was the last time that happened? - very awesome on their part) and informed me that they have upgraded the cabling.

I was in search of a complimentary case to protect my new Nexus 7 tablet and found and order this product a few weeks ago. So far I can say I am completely satisfied with the product. I know that there have been concerns in previous reviews of the bulk of this product but I can say that for my use the added bulk provides me with a sense of security in protecting my tablet. sure it adds a small amount of bulk to the original thin case of the Nexus 7 but not enough to warrant not buying this product. Any cover is going to add a certain amount of bulk to the tablet its holding. The only reason I dis not give this product 5 stars was because I think the folding option of the leather case is a bit weak. It still works and provides a mechanism for standing the tablet in either a horizontal or vertical position but takes some adjustment at times to get it right. I can see that possibly with further use on down the road the crease allowing the case to serve as a stand would become to weak to support the tablet as a stand.

"Guy Sepranza what a unique and amazing voice, one of the best ever! Riot simply knew how to throw down some good rock n roll and Narita is just another great example of getting it done. Riot should have been one of the best bands ever with their debut of Rock City, and the follow up album Narita alone they should have been on every radio station across America and if that didnt do it then the next album Fire Down Under should have sent them flying to the top.Im amazed at how they were treated by the record companies. Its hard to find a band during this time period that did it any better than did Riot. Everything was right about this band and is evident with Narita. One of the best frontman in the business, with Mark Reales scourching guitar, and the rockn tightness of the rest of the band, thats just hard to beat.I think anyone would love this band after one listen alone. While Narita is for some reason a little pricy at this time and your interested in hearing Riot and havent before, prior to investing in Narita I would highly suggest first purchasing Rock City at $7.00 your getting a steal and the classic Fire Down Under is even cheaper than Narita and IMHO a better album.I love this band and you will too !","12 31, 2011",RIOT IS PURE ROCK AND ROLL,1325289600,CDVinyl

"What I like:1. The look. Nice solid design.2. Ease of putting Kindle into case. Just place your Kindle in case. Magnets hold it in place. I found the magnets to be strong enough to hold the Kindle, even when you shake it and turn if upside down.3. The stand. The front cover folds back, then folds together to make a cool and sturdy stand. I had another case where the stand slipped, but this one stays securely in place.What I don't like:1. Having to slide the Kindle partially out of the case in order to use the rear facing camera. This is a royal pain and when I do this the Kindle often becomes loose, so you are at risk of either dropping the case or the Kindle or both.2. The weight. This case more then doubles the weight of your Kindle.3. Does not include a screen protector. If you happen to put your Kindle face down while the case is open or God forbid, drop it while using it, then there is nothing to protect the screen or corners from being damaged or scratched.Other reviewers have noted that there is no opening for the speakers.

"I have been wanting a device like this one for years.  I have smart TVs in the livingroom and bedroom, but have never gotten around to wiring the ethernet cables.  I live in a very old house, so going under it is scary and dangerous, especially at my age.  Wiring through the attic would be difficult due to the layout of the house.  I was to the point of considering running the cables outside where they would be slightly visible.Happily Google came to my assistance and solved two of my problems with this one device.  I can now view my recorded movie files and Netflix, etc.  in the bedroom and use the smaller of our Samsung Tab 3 tablets as a remote.  In the bedroom before, I had to turn a light on to see some of the more complex remote operations and the remote on that particular TV is the type that if you punch a wrong button to pause or restart, it goes to live tv and you lose your place on the recording on the USB.  I doubt many people watch movies, etc from a USB stick, but I do, because I live in a very remote area and it's a miracle I even get live tv... ah well.  Anyhow, the Tab 3 makes its own light so that problem is solved as wellBut with the Tab 3, the Videostream app and the Chromecast dongle, I can watch movie files direct from my PC in 720p without bothering anyone else in the family who wants to use the internet.  Of course it does use the internet if I want to watch Netflix or its clones, so with only a 6Mb/s service some time sharing has to be done.Other members of the family that already bought Chromecast dongles report that it works fine for HBO GO, but not for Amazon or Dish Anywhere or Xfinity.

"I've had this for one week now and overall I'm pretty happy with it, and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it best.  The sound from the 3 speaker system is great, better than expected, and a vast improvement over a $30 bluetooth speaker I had been using in my car.  If the FM transmitter feature didn't work, I'd still be happy with the sound quality I get for my music, which is probably the most important feature for me with this device.  BUT THE FM TRANSMITTER DOES WORK for me in my 2002 Toyota Corolla, despite the problems other reviewers have complained about and the problems in general with FM transmitter technology.  And I live in a dense urban area.  It's great to have my tunes on my car stereo, as well as calls and my voice navigation or whatever else I'm doing.  For me, I've found a couple stations that work fine for my commute to work and around town that I don't have to change stations for.  I don't know how well it will work on a long roadtrip in other areas but we'll see.It does charge in two hours in my car or in any USB port, and the battery life is extremely good so far.  The item is small enough to put in my pocket if I want to take it in the house to charge, or I can pop it in my glove box if I don't want it visible when my car is parked in a questionable neighborhood.  Also, I've had no problem with the automatic on and off feature, works fine for me; and it's really no big deal to use the manual on/off switch anyway so I don't know why anyone would complain about that.The Jabra website has a more detailed and easier to read User Manual that you can download, which is easier to read and follow than the tiny little booklet that comes with the original packaging.  Also, there's a new driver for download on the website which is easy to install (it doesn't tell you this, but just connect your Freeway to your computer USB port and then execute/run the driver download file that you've downloaded to that computer).  New driver installs automatically.  Other reviewers complained that the voice prompts are too loud, but they don't sound too loud to me, so maybe they did fix this problem with the driver update.The biggest problem I've had is with Voice Assistant.  I made a couple calls with it.  Not sure how useful it will be for me.  Because Freeway does work with my android personal assistant app (Speaktoit Assistant) running on my Galaxy Centura phone (a Siri like app for android).  This gives me the ability to make calls directly, and access numerous other apps on my phone (music player, Scout GPS navigation, social networking apps, calendar, etc.  And my Assistant will read my incoming text messages, send texts or emails, get news, weather and search for anything.  So I'm not really sure that I need Voice Assist anyway.  It's also a pain to setup your contacts separately with your Voice Assist account and then I will manually have to keep updating/syncing my contacts with Voice Assist.  That's a hassle I don't need.  Also, I've now tried having Voice Assist read my emails.  This is useful.  However, Voice Assist has a really terrible robotic female voice, really primitive by today's standards.  I can't believe they use such a terrible robotic speech engine.  Very unpleasant.Also, although it pairs automatically with my phone with a very easy setup, for some reason I've had to repair it a few times when it hasn't connected automatically.  Not sure why this is happening.The Freeway doesn't always recognize my voice commands--there are only a handful and they're simple like ""Play"" for play music, or ""Battery"" to check battery level, but it's frustrating when I have to repeat myself several times, and I'm not sure why this happens sometimes and not other times.I make and receive very few calls in my car, so if this was my most important feature I'd definitely have to lower my rating.  Also, while Freeway is working good with my Speaktoit Assistant, I discovered it wouldn't work at all with an alternative top-rated android assistant I was trying out, Nuance's Dragon Mobility Assistant.I'll update my review later after I've had more experience.UPDATE:  After two more weeks of usage, I'm downgrading this to 3 stars.  The voice/command recognition, with or without Voice Assist, is very poor.  It's very frustrating to repeat commands five or six times and still not have them understood.  I have a clear loud voice, no accent.  Very frustrating.","11 13, 2013",OK but lots of  Problems with Voice Assist & Recognizing Commands,1384300800,CellPhone

My phone noramlly dies and needs to be charged around 2pm - 3 at the latest, but with this new battery I'm making it till around 7pm (I believe that matches the big bulky extended battery performance).

"I wasn't expecting so little reviews for such a fantastic album here on amazon.  It surely deserves to be experienced by more music fans, especially those who are fans of southern rock.I believe the Marshall Tucker Band (the band) has two strengths.  One, their creative and imaginative lyrical imagery.  Most of their music reminds me of fields upon fields that never seem to end, along with rivers, skies and anything else related to spiritual energy.  I realize I sound goofy by expressing my feelings in such a way, but I honestly can't help it.  The Marshall Tucker Band's second main strength are their occasional attempts at instrumental variety (not really utilized on this particular album, mind you, but later on in the bands career... yeah- mellotrons, flutes, and other lovely arrangements).""My Jesus Told Me So"" is a classic.  I love the soulful verse melody and the spiritual chorus.  There's a short guitar solo later on that's positively great.  ""Ramblin"" is memorable for a *magnificent* guitar jam in the middle.  Judging by the fairly ordinary, jazzy verse melody in the beginning, I wasn't expecting such a top notch jam to suddenly appear out of nowhere like that.  I hear subtle shades of the legendary Allman Brothers Band in that guitar jam.The big hit (that continues to receive radio play to this very day, might I add) is ""Can't You See"".  I originally wasn't the biggest fan of this song, but that has all changed in recent years.  I finally grew up and learned to appreciate the soulful passion in the vocal melody, which by the way, is the main thing that carries the song.Now my number one favorite song (and perhaps my favorite song the Marshall Tucker Band ever created) is the opener titled ""Take the Highway"".  GREAT vocal melody- perhaps the greatest vocal melody I have honestly ever experienced by a southern rock band.  I think very highly of it.  Other high points include ""See You Later, I'm Gone"" which is nothing especially unique or anything- just a nicely written country song with lovely guitar licks in between the verse melody.I believe this album deserves more attention than it's received over the years.  Not really an Allman Brothers Band wannabe band or anything like that.  I mean, if THAT'S the reason people aren't listening to the Marshall Tucker Band, it's foolish reasoning, I can assure you.","06 14, 2011","short, but sweet",1308009600,CDVinyl

"PROS+ Solid Realistic Gameplay. Decent Campaign Maps, Even better Online Maps.+ Sound is Amazing. Probably the best I have heard in a Game.+ It is a game that grows on you. Almost sold it, then I played on.CONS- Way over-hyped for what it is.- Graphics lack detail and definition.- Multiplayer can be a little glitchy at times. Still working out the bugs.The game is good, don't get me wrong. However the graphics are a HUGE let down. While they are atmospheric and the lighting is good, there is very little detail on walls and objects. Looks cartoonish like, pre-Battlefield 2/Modern Warfare 2 graphics. They advertised it as a leap in graphic technology. Well, they took a leap in the wrong direction. There is a constant filter on the game which looks like someone splattered a can so soda all over your TV. This is a huge distraction and makes it difficult to see who is shooting you. I understand they were going for realism, however I don't see dots everywhere.You work in a team and are very rarely alone. There is a story and it does jump around the time line, however due to the very basic AI I seem to have lost interest quite quickly. Characters move well, however skin looks unrealistic an characters reaction seems off. If you're in a squad and someone gets shot, the other team members don't seem to react, as they should, if they react at all. Also there are floating object like sandbags and other items which are scattered around the map. This is very annoying.Battlefield 3 does have a little more to offer than your basic shooter. It is a difficult game at times and you do need to listen to your teammates and work together at times, which I one reason I disliked it so much. It is a war game, however you need to plan your actions and not just spray bullets everywhere. They were going more for the realism of war. In the game you are not just on foot, you are up in a plane, driving a tank, and even skydiving. There is enough to keep you busy and interested, however I just got bored with basic mechanics of the game. I felt like I have done this again and again. Nothing impressed me about this game and I was ultimately disappointed.With the right surround system, Battlefield 3 has some of the best sound I have heard in a game. Over-all Battlefield does give the fans what they want, however it was hyped up too much for how little graphic detail there is. In the end it is a basic shooter which we played 5 years ago. Nothing new. After playing Infamous 2 and Arkham City I am expecting more from games lately.

I feel that this is a trick. I thought both parts are the latest III versions!My first Bose purchase was in Dec 2011 (original Music System with original Multi-CD Changer). The CD changer of that set made noise as it changed CDs and so many complained about their CDs getting stuck. Plus that system set completely went dead on me after 2 weeks. All lights were lit, Music system appeared to be responding to the remote control but no sound was coming out at all. I changed the remote battery, changed the remote control itself, connections checked, electrical outlet checked, confirmed that the music system was not on 'mute' . . . but the whole system was still dead silent.I wouldn't even try to exchange or re-order because many people had complaints about this original 3-CD Multi-CD Changer and for many, the problem occured after the 1-yr warranty and Bose refused to do anything about their cases.I will (and should have had!) be getting a more reliable music system from a local electronics store.","11 29, 2012",bad CD changer,1354147200,Electronics
"I have several webcams/network cams and security video systems. My favorite is a Panasonic BL-C131A wireless network cam which has been running for over four years 24/7 pointing out our front window onto the porch. The Panasonic has excellent picture quality and fantastic software. The Dlink costs less but has a few quircks.First off the Dlink DCS-933L webcam is slow to connect to the network and it is slow to open the video every time you open or change to the video web page. These aren't huge issues because you rely on motion detection most of the time, however, motion detection requires JAVA to set up.Installation did not go according to instructions but it's not that hard to set up. I used (and prefer) the browser to set up and access my webcams instead of installing software. This way you have the same interface anywhere in the world.  I tried the D-View Cam software but immediately ran into trouble so didn't bother with it and uninstalled it.The built-in software has too much extra junk on the screen so that you have to scroll to see the full cam view. Yet there are no record, snapshot or other useful functions while viewing the image. It takes several seconds for the image to come up each time you visit the page. Brightness and other controls are on a separate screen so you can't see the image as you make changes - bizarre.This is the only cam that I have ever used that requires JAVA to run MJPEG video and for setting up areas for motion detection.  Unfortunately you have to install JAVA if you want to use motion detection because you have to CLICK all of the areas to MAKE THEM WORK (contrary to what the screen says). The manual states otherwise and in order to see the screen to click it you must install JAVA.You can only select one FTP server. The Panasonic allows you to setup several different triggering times and options each having its own FTP settings. For instance, for one trigger I have it capture an image every second for a web page, other triggers are set for motion detection and upload to a different server.Accessing this from outside of your network is as easy as setting up port forwarding on your router. Works great!Image quality indoors is really good especially getting correct colors. I tried to point it outside through the window but the image was washed out and I couldn't get it adjusted to see much.Caution when updating firmware, the links on their website are not correct even though you click on the specific camera and choose firmware you aren't taken to the link specific to that camera on the next page, you must select it again.I like the size of this little cam for the picture quality it gives. The small size makes it easy to take with you or move around which can come in handy.It's a decent, wireless cam, nice size and fairly easy to set up. But with its few quirks including having to install JAVA make it not so attractive.","07 10, 2013","Great picture quality, nice size but with quircks",1373414400,Electronics

"So when I ordered this, I thought I had a Tab 3. Turns out, I have a Tab 2. Oops. So...it still works perfectly fine and finds the device, but the Tab 2 doesn't snap nicely into the case. We have a rubberized case on our 2, so because it's sort of grippy I can lean it against the back of the case (which has a nifty propper-upper) and it stays put. Not perfect (and doesn't fold up inside really well bc our rubberized case is pretty bulky), but it works!The keyboard has a nice feel and pairing it with the device was super easy. It also takes the same charger as the Tab 2, which is nice. The key placement takes some adjustment bc it is smaller (and the apostrophe is in a really weird place to me!), but it's not too bad. All of the function keys seem to work on the 2, and I LOVE having copy/paste buttons! (I am able to copy/paste on my phone, but it's basically by randomly hitting stuff until it works...this is way better.) Very happy with this. I plan on taking the tablet with the keyboard to use on vacation rather than my laptop.

"Hello folks,This is one very pleasing record to listen to. Lowell's voice is the greatest feature of this record, followed by great performances from many talented studio musicians, Bill Payne & Ritchie Hayward from Little Feat amongst them.Sonically, the album sounds fantastic, with all the songs having a polished sound about them that defies the records age ! Very well engineered, recorded, & produced. And the tune selection for the record very much relates back to Lowell's own preferred musical stylings, deciding to cover other artists tunes, than write / record too many of his own. I guess he saved his other many new songs for what would become Little Feats fine album Down on the Farm.Overall, an excellent record, & if it does one thing only for me, it would be to remind me of how great a talent Lowell George was, & what an amazing singing voice he had. Dearly missed by everyone I have no doubt, & what a tragedy that there are no more solo recordings made by him.This is definitely one of the top 10 records to be released in 1979, & one of the best for it's time to listen to now.

"Hands down the most beautiful game I have seen. The visuals are so gorgeous and crisp. The color palette is amazing. I think best words to describe the game &#34;Visual Porn&#34;. The game play is a little different from standard shooters. The guns have a weighty feel to it and will take a while to get used to. Sony could not have picked a more prettier game to show case the potential of next gen. Of all the other next gen games - Knack, AC4, etc only KZ has utilized the touch pad properly and meaningful way. The story is interesting but definitely nothing to write home about. I have not tried the multiplayer yet. Sony had a lot of balls to release this game along with other shooter heavy weights such as COD and BF4 and I will admire them for that.If you have a PS4 and want a game to give you a glimpse in to next gen this is the game for you.

"The title is worse than the film. When the Spanish version offers a title which is translated as 'The Wages of Violence', you know that you're in for a long haul. The story of a gnarled old patriarch (Van Heflin) with two entirely different sons, a baddie played by Tab Hunter and a goodie, played by James Darren, is easily outlassed by 'Broken Lance' where Spencer Tracy has similar problems with his brood. Heflin is no Tracy, and neither Hunter nor Darren can compare with Richard Widmark. The theme, so inanely developed here, had been covered before in 'Duel in the Dust' where Joseph Cotten is the goodie, and Gregory Peck is the baddie. The trouble is that Jennifer Jones is more seductive and feistier than Kathryn Grant even if neither of them gives any indication of native American roots. I like Van Heflin. He was great in 'Shane' and pretty effective in '3.10 to Yuma', but when he breaks down in tears at the end of this movie, I sympathise with him.

"This is the fourth case for Kindle I have tried through Vine.Let's run through some good and bad things together.Good:-Very vibrant and colorful, I love the ""pop"" of the cover- Microfiber material already feels better to the touch than the other models I've tried- Two fold out stands allow for two angles of viewing ala kickstands-Looks worth the price compared to other models.-Auto wake magnet work better than Belkin's cover (no backwards Kindle!) and allows for shut cover charging (the Belkin doesn't)!-The quality feels superior to other tablet covers (see below)-Despite the smaller band's holding the Kindle unit feels in better hands than the BUILT or Belkin covers.Bad:-I never have the feeling that the manufacturers of tablet covers charge a fair price; at 50$ , this is the most expensive free cover I own and feel it's possibly worth twenty tops.. but the 35$ ones feel worth 10$, so that may be saying something for the quality of this.-The band's that support the Kindle are smaller than the BUILT cuffs and not as sturdy as the Belkin snaps... this may be bad to some potential buyers though as I said I like this method more.-The ribbons holding the tablet stands in seem cheap... but magnets hold them fine.-It is a little thicker than other covers but I chalk this up to being a superior case.When I first reviewed this, I was happy, but now that 4 months have passed, I'd like to add the following to the list of bad things:-It is folding in slightly (the interior cardboard.. or whatever is inside it... is bending up), at the corners.-The ribbon that holds the cover shut (or open) is becoming slightly unglued.It is still my favorite case, but after a few months of minor handling, it's evident that this case is not exactly great at all, but it is still better than the other cases I think.","03 29, 2013",Pretty eye popping case!,1364515200,Electronics

"The positive attributes of this series are the very convoluted plots and skilled actors. I give them A's for both. Believable roles played by actors with the talent to fit.  Excellent casting.  I can't emphasize enough.There are several plots and subplots. What I like most is the satisfactory resolution of each story line in each episode;compounded by back stories on each of the characters which is ongoing and continues to develop.No character leads a perfect life. Although completely believable, are not like anyone I would know personally. Sometimes I am amused or disgusted by their foibles and other times, I sympathize. In short, there are plenty of twists and turns to contemplate, lots of complexity in the plots.I am a little curious about &#34;Will Gardner&#34;....he looks tired, with dark circles around his eyes. Is this intended to show him in ill health? Is that makeup or are we experiencing foreshadowing?I'm not so sure I would ever vote for Mr. Frollic....he needs to be made more loveable, so far is is half Rat.Eli Gold...love him...his body language fits the complexity of his role...his x-wife, however, doesn't fit. Great casting here.Calinda...interesting role...not so sure her &#34;secrets&#34; are that important in this age.  The actress does a good job playing that part, however. Her wardrobe is completely unprofessional for a law office. But I suppose she does most of her work in the street.She needs to have some changes of wardrobe to fit in with the variety of places she must go to investigate. An undercover agent would probably do that.The good wife...her role, so far, hasn't been about being a wife, thank goodness. Running around in high heels all the time isn't to realistic...she needs to dress in tennis shoes then change to heels, much more believable in the big city.Cary...so cute, he deserves more complexity, perhaps it will develop in his role over time.Lockhart...powerful role, done really well. She may be headed for a nervous breakdown??Who is my favorite character?  Calinda, I think. Always wondering what the firm will give her to investigate...much more important than her private life.Maddy...another political Rat.The Mothers-in-Law....well, can't you just strangle them. No advice here. Their roles so far just irritate and provide pause before the main plots.  Perhaps they &#34;need a lawyer&#34; now and then as their high jinks could be made amazing.Although the characters look professional in clothing, etc. as indicative of a professional law firm, there is no overblown fluff about designer clothing, labels or false glamour. It's all about the plot(s).  Thank you, some aspects like costume design need to be in background....by the way, the costume designer is doing a great job.Some nights I watch 2 or 3 episodes on Amazon Prime and am never bored.  Excellent guest performances provide relief from too much inbreeding.Michael J. Fox is outstanding and I'm so pleased to see him back in his game. He has been missed on TV.All in all....one of the best series on TV!

The hand crank is easy to turn - I've never had a situation where this ran out of juice.It does AM/FM radio - but it doesn't find stations for you or let you store favorites. You have to run through the band a step at a time until you find something that works. It gets all the strong stations, but on my camping trip a friend had a different kind of emergency radio that got a few more stations and seemed to have better reception overall.The flashlight was very valuable, though - it's quite strong and proved useful on a number of occasions. It also helped me get a bit of juice into my iPhone when it was running low.Overall, this is a very valuable thing to have around when you're out and about and away. Essential for emergencies.I was given a sample unit by the manufacturer for the purpose of testing and review.","07 23, 2013","Useful for emergencies, camping, etc. - the flashlight works great, radio function is decent",1374537600,Electronics
"I will not go in to technical details as other reviewers have gone in to extreme details with that. But I will post my impressions. I've read and watched raving reviews about this amazing lens and about it's predecessor, the Mark I for quite some time. I had to pull the trigger on this because I wanted 1:)a 70mm + telephoto zoom lens 2:) it had to be an L Grade lens. I purchased the 5D Mark II already and this was obviously a no brainer, but... the price was an issue. After contemplating for months, I've once again persuaded my wife in to purchasing this lens. I honestly don't think I can purchase any more after this. :)I use this lens with my 5D Mark II and am amazed thoroughly as is exceeded all of my expectations.1.) It is HEAVY, but not too bad. (I can't justify shooting all day with this attached though)2.) No lens protrusion on the front as you zoom in and out. This was evident on the 24-105mm f/4 L and I get scared of dust and debris getting inside the lens barrel.3.)Zoom Ring and Focus rings are very smooth turning and focus noise is almost non existent and the focus speed is blazingly fast.4.) constant f/2.8 aperture all throughout the zoom range.The lens features IS, which is a life saver because it is extremely difficult to steady this lens even at f2.8. This is where the IS helps to stabilize the image so that the shots stay sharp. This lens is by far my sharpest lens as all shots come out super sharp and clear with amazing clarity and color and it continues to amaze me. I cannot think about shooting with the IS off because it shakes like crazy hand held (I do not have the steadiest hands). It comes with a carrying case and a twist off lens hood made of great quality plastic and has velvet-like material inside the hood to minimize the chance of light bouncing off while using it. A B+W UV Haze Filter (77mm) is absolutely necessary to protect the lens element and please do not settle for a UV filter of lesser quality. B+W is great in this regard.PROS:+Amazing construction and solid build quality.+Constant f/2.8 aperture.+Superb VERY SHARP image quality.+Image Stabilization (Thank goodness)+Weather and Dust sealed/resistant+L Series Lens+Superior Optics+Comes with Lens Hood and Case!CONS:-Price (Well worth it though).-A little on the heavy side.Every day I take the lens out of the bag to admire it and marvel over this amazing piece of perfection and you will too.","08 25, 2011",Outstanding lens!

"There's nothing too deep to be found in this film.  True, inner-city life is rough, but I'm fairly certain anyone watching this film was either aware of this or has only just come out of a seventy-year coma.  But if you're just looking for a nice film about kids on an underdog team beating the odds (sorry if I spoiled it there), then this is the film for you.  There are certainly a few heart-wrenching scenes, but Keanu Reeves provides none of them.  Stick to driving fast busses, Mr. Reeves.  And was it just me or was there no romantic chemistry...or for that matter, any actual chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane, his ""love interest""?  Any scenes between seemed forced, especially on her part...but again, that's might just be me.

An excellent prodcution in both action and storyline. The one criticism I had was that it seemed like there was an excessive amount of searing used. It's almost like it was used to hype the work and far exceeded the amount needed. I am constantly aware of how much violence and vulgarity is used on a regular basis in movies. When it becomes one of the standars by which a work of art is judged than it exceeds all rational need for its usage. And with the caliber of actors such as John Travolta there is no need to bring on so much abusive languages especially with children watching this movie. One might also argue that there was too much violence and of course this too is a judgment call.

"I have been extremely pleased with Brainwavz S1 headphones. I have not been very impressed with any of the in-ear headphones I have tried in the past due to lack of comfort and poor sound quality. Brainwavzs has a developed a product that has addressed these areas and offers more.Firstly, the ear buds fit comfortably and don't tug on the ears. After an hour of wearing these headphones, my ears still feel fine.  The company includes several different options for inner ear tips. It is trial and error to find the ones that work for you. Secondly, the sound quality is great for my uses. I tried these on an airplane to watch a movie and during a work out to listen to music. As advertised, the bass and vocals were clear and not overbearing. Though they didn't cancel sound as the bulkier headphones do, but the sounds quality was impressive while on the airplane. To note, I did not try any tips other than the tri-flange tips during the plane trip. Additionally, when the outside of the earbuds are rubbed or brush against something during sound play, the sound is not impacted.Some added features that add to this product are the flat wires that cut back on tangling. This seems to work well. They did not require any untangling when getting them out for use. The hard earphone carrying case is great and small.Overall, this is an excellent product. They offer excellent sounds quality in a compact size and an affordable price. I recommend these for anyone searching for good quality ear buds.","03 29, 2014",In ear wonders,1396051200,Electronics

"Eastern Promises is undoubtedly a fantastic film. It felt to me like a Russian Goodfellas, or Godfather in essence, of course without the scale and grandiose of those classic mafia films. Maybe it could have been if there were more time devoted to the Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), and not more than half of the movie devoted to the prostitute Tatiana and her daughter. I understand that's what the story was about, and I'm basically complaining about the main plot of the story, but I loved Nikolai's character so much that I wanted to see much more of him. That truly is more of a testiment to Mortensen's performance than it is a criticism of the film. If there were a little more depth to the story (it's only an hour and a half), I wouldn't mind it so much. I just felt like every time I would get sucked into Nikolai's world, the baby subplot pulled me out a little more than I would have liked. I will say though, I really liked how the story came full circle and connected the multiple dots in a very interesting way.This is, like I said, a fantastic film. It has possibly the tensest fight scene that I have ever seen. Major respect goes to Viggo for doing it fully nude. I'm sure thousands of Lord of the Rings chicks lost their marbles after that one. That scene is superb enough for me to recommend this movie to everyone. But as a part of your collection, I am not sure it's for everyone. I enjoy it enough to own it, but I recommend it as a rental first for each to decide for themselves. The transfer iv quite qell done.

"I saw it at a house party, having heard how wonderful a picture it was supposed to be.  The scenery was beautiful, and the mass movement of buffalo was impressive.  But for all the acclaim the movie has gotten, these were the only merits the movie had.The story is very slow-moving, and the characters are all stereotypes.  The Sioux are the ""good"" Indians, the Pawnee, enemies of the Sioux, are the ""evil"" Indians, and the US military (except for the protagonist Lt. Dunbar) are such total buffoons they make the Keystone Kops look like models of professionalism.  The story itself is full of improbabilities too.  A white woman kidnapped by the Pawnee as a child (and later retrieved by the Sioux) is suddenly able to speak English to Lt. Dunbar, and when Dunbar returns to his fellow soldiers, they shoot his horse and after dozens of shots, kill Dunbar's pet wolf, who stayed around and let the bullets fly at him.  (Like even incompetent soldiers would waste valuable ammunition killing animals for no reason.  Sheesh.)It should be noted that none other than MAD Magazine wrote a parody cartoon of this movie, in which it compared ""Dances With Wolves"" with other current movies-the major comparison being that none of them were an honest depiction of the American Indian.

"I tried watching this, the fourth or fifth film adaptation of Fitzgerald's superb 1925 novel ""The Great Gatsby"" but I stopped a mere 10% or so of the way through because this production is simply WRONG.  The casting doesn't work, for starters.  Paul Rudd mugs and often looks like he's about to deliver a comic line.  Martin Donovan is too soft and oddly petulant as the powerful, arrogant and callous (sociopathic?) Tom Buchanan.  Ms. Sorvino lacks Daisy's ethereal musicality and seductiveness....no one looks or feels right in their roles.  The screenplay is so literal at times, quoting narration and dialogue word for word, and then suddenly leaves out sentences or phrases or simply makes up dialogue, scenes and plot points.  The actor's hair is wrong, not at all in period and that is one production detail that always irks me.This is a poor production of a great American work.  But far, FAR worse will be the up coming Baz Luhrman travesty, the trailer for which I just cringed through.  It is a 3D monstrosity, perhaps better titled ""Moulin Gatsby"".When o when are movie makers going to realize and respect the fact that they cannot ever capture the poetic delicacy and lyric beauty of Fitzgerald's writing???  How to ever capture the essense of his vision of The American Dream turned corrupted nightmare?

"I have been a frustrated Win PC user for 14 years.  For 2 years I have created dual-booting Win/Ubuntu desktops and laptops for myself.  After reading reviews for imacs, and the Jobs biography, I decided to give Macs a chance.I purchased this computer 2 days ago and I put it through the ringer in that short time.I will start my review by writing about things I did not like about my imac.I uploaded my personal files and the imac froze during the copying process on some of my pictures TWICE!  I had to force quit finder during copying of pictures.  I have been using the ext hard drive on my win and linux machines and I have never had this issue EVER.Second, I was surprised at how slow apps seemed to open up.  I have opened up the apps the mac came with (icalc, imovie, iphoto, safari etc), as well as apps I installed (Open office, chrome, vlc are some of the apps).  The majority of the apps took a long time to load when compared to my ubuntu machines, and just as long as my Windows XP/Vista machines.  Open Office was the slowest of the apps at starting up.On the bright side, I did notice that the wireless card in my imac seems to give me faster uploads and downloads compared to any of my other machines.  I have a wired desktop and 3 wireless devices, and all 4 have slower upload and download speeds.I also love the beautiful lcd on my imac.  I couldn't stop staring at it the first couple hours out of the box.  Everything is clear and look forward to viewing HD content on my imacA third great thing about my imac is that I love how everything is all bound together (icloud, itunes, etc). I have a nano and touch so it is nice to know my mac apps will be synced together with all my data automatically.I am also excited to use Time Machine once I get one of my external hard drives ready for use. I have been using Carbonite to help with backing up, and I have been doing my own external hard drive backing up, but Time Machine seems to be an app I may enjoy and appreciateOverall, I am glad I purchased my imac, but if I am being honest, the price is too much for what I purchased.  Maybe I will feel differently if my imac lasts me longer than my longest running Win desktop (6 years), or if performance does not deteriorate over time like it does on Win machines, but I already see great lasting performance on my linux machines (and the ubuntu os is free).I may add another star to my review if I never see a file copying issue over the next year, or if I see an improvement in load times with apps.  But as of today, I took 1 star off for the slower than expected loading of apps and another star for the cost vs value of the iMac.UPDATE 12-3-11Apps seem to be loading quicker and the whole computer seems to be running better... I didn't do anything to it.  I also haven't run into the copying issue I did when I first wrote my review.  Still feel iMac is over priced, but I gave my review 1 more star because the computer is running A LOT faster than those first couple days I was using it.","11 26, 2011",Good Computer...but EXPENSIVE!,1322265600,Electronics

"If you know Painter, there's not much I can add about the program in general.  There's nothing else like it. It's an art studio in a box, on your computer. Allowing an almost infinite creativity to take shape.  It's the sort of program where the key learning task isn't the software itself, it's learning how to draw, or paint, or design.  Useful for sketching, for composing, for testing out ideas, for putting together test pieces. Allows you to discover new processes and try new mediums. No, of course it's not an exact replica of real painting or drawing. But it is as close as a computer can get, mimicking the textures and attributes of a very wide array of mediums.If you don't know Painter, get to know it if you are a serious artist who wants to expand to computer based approaches.  Or if you're a budding artist.  It definitely helps to have an Intuous pad of one kind or another, but this isn't absolutely essential (well, maybe it is in a way...)I've owned previous versions. If you own the most recent version, there's not really a big reason to upgrade. The perspective lines are quite helpful and there are improvements across the board, but nothing so substantial to justifying paying a lot of money. Of course, if you're a teacher or student you can get this for a big discount, just look up the academic version.I loaded this on my Dell 15R touchscreen laptop and am happy to say it works great with the touchscreen. Very responsive.  The screen itself is not anything near as sensitive an Intuos, but it definitely works quite well.No downsides or glitches or negatives that I've seen here. Runs smoothly, runs great even on a far from top of the line computer.  Corel makes great software that works and works without the constant nagging that Adobe insists on.","10 9, 2013",Painter is in a class by itself,1381276800,Electronics
"I love how snug this strap is. It keeps my camera very close and accessible while comfortably staying in place. I've been out walking with my camera on this strap for a few hours and it works well and doesn't get uncomfortable.That said, it's just not practical to use when the weather is cold and you've got on several layers of clothes. It begins to feel too restricting - and this strap is absolutely meant to stay snugly close to the body, so it's not an option to just wear it totally loose. It's irritating to wear particularly if you need to put on/take off your jacket throughout the day. And forget about using the strap if you like wearing loose-fitting hoodies - the camera gets lost in the hoodie while you feel every fold of it being pressed against your body.The strap screws in neatly to the bottom of your camera, where you would normally attach your camera to a tripod (so it goes without saying that you need to take the strap off if you want to attach your camera to a tripod or monopod).This camera strap is nice when I'm out and on the go in warm weather, but I need to find a good strap for the rest of the year...","02 11, 2013",Great Strap for Summertime,1360540800,Electronics

"The claymation was, strictly speaking, just incredible.  The story was fresh and alive, and also very close to the original given that this one takes place in the modern day.  The mood is set during the first five minutes of the piece, and Prokofiev's music doesn't begin until Petr opens the gate to what seems to be held as ""the wild"", which is wonderful in that it is so much nicer than the world Petr knows.  The music begins at this point and shows the wonder that Petr feels when he steps into the frontier that he's been forbidden to experience.  All in all, a great work.  If only all remakes/retellings could be this good.Umm, spoiler alert:Petr has a hard lesson to learn during this story.  It's a lesson that I've been slowly introducing to my young ones as they get bigger.  There are a lot of scary things out there in the world, but a hungry wolf in winter is still not as scary as an ignorant human with a gun.  The wolf is doing what it needs to stay alive, whereas humans that do terrible things rarely have anywhere near as good a reason, and unfortunately there are far more of the latter.  I was surprised but happy that this Petr showed compassion and understanding.  I didn't see forgiveness or contrition in either of their eyes, but I did seem to see some shared understanding, though that could just be because of how late it is...

"Yes, it's finally happened, after years of threats of it never seeing the light of day again, and then a reissue being cancelled a while back, With Sympathy is finally here--with some worthy bonus tracks. You get the non-album track ""A Walk in the Park"", the original 12"" mix of ""I Wanted to Tell Her"" that runs 7:06, and a mystery extended remix of ""Revenge"" that may have been created specifically for this release. There are absolutely no liner notes or credits for the bonus tracks. While it's cool to have this extended version of Revenge, it really pales in comparison to the album version. The rhythm track is much more stomp heavy rather than driving, causing the feel of the song to drag. The most unfortunate news about this release is that they did not include the original 12"" mix of Work for Love. It's actually kind of surprising. Perhaps they couldn't find an original master or a mint condition vinyl single to master from.As for the booklet, it is pretty much the same exact booklet that came with the original release of the CD decades ago. Same front and back as the album (with the bonus tracks included on the back cover track list), and inside is just the single black and white photo of the guys on the left with the liner notes for each song next to it and on the facing page. However, there is absolutely NO mention of the bonus tracks on the inside, so as I said, we don't get any credits for remixers, song lengths, etc.Sound quality is excellent, crystal clear.

"After trying theRHA MA-350 Aluminium Sound Isolating In-Ear Earbuds - 3 year warrantyfor my own use, I had the opportunity to try these over-ear headphones as well.While my preference is still the earbuds, these were amazingly lightweight with a nice sound that got better the more they were used. Unlike some headphones, I did not feel like I was held captive by their weight. I have a small head, and these fit nicely and snugly on my hard to fit smaller head size.On the other hand, my husband has the opposite problem, he has trouble finding headphones that fit comfortably over his larger head size. Amazingly, these fit him equally well!  Because they are so light, he is using them much more, allowing a bit more quiet in the living room we share.While they minimize background noise, it is still possible to hear all of the important noises, including the doorbell and telephone ringing, while providing a clear sound. I tested them in a variety of settings with a variety of music. I did notice that they weren't base heavy in the selections I chose, and seemed to be best in the pop and country music rather than the full orchestra.My husband has a bad habit of sitting things down on couch next to him where I sit, and I have a bad habit of not looking before I sit, so these have received the ultimate in sturdiness testing, I sat on them. I didn't have to test to see if this was covered under their three year warranty, since they did not break.I am grateful to have had the opportunity to receive a complimentary set for testing purposes.","05 9, 2012","Fit various sizes, light, sturdy, good sound.",1336521600,Electronics
"I was not originally planning on writing a review for this movie, but I really thought it was a good movie, well worth watching, so I wanted to do my part to get the star count up. The movie is kind of a mix between a black comedy and a tragic romance. The movie lacks a single tone. Some might say that this movie lacks unity, or that it does not know what it wants to be, but it struck just the right chord for me. I think the combination is perfect.It seems like I rarely really laugh at comedies anymore, but this movie had some truly hilarious moments. It opens with a radio announcement that the last mission to save humanity from an asteroid hurtling toward the earth has failed, but that the radio station is going to continue bringing their listeners a countdown to the apocalypse, along with all their favorite classic rock hits. That opening sets the tone for the first part of the movie and all the absurd behavior of the human race in the face of their imminent demise. Highlights from the comedy side of the film include the relationship between Dodge (Steve Carrell) and his housekeeper, and the scene in the Friendly's (whoever the actor was who played the host did a brilliant job). I rarely see comedy that I think is this good, but this movie is more than just a comedy.Now I must give my SPOILER ALERT. The rest of the movie is about the relationship that forms between Dodge (Steve Carrell) and Penny (Keira Knightly) as they attempt to track down Dodge's high school sweetheart and get Penny back to England to see her family. In some ways we have seen this part of the movie before. The two strangers who set out on a mission together, both looking for something, but who wind up finding each other instead. While this is somewhat of a formula, it is a formula I happen to like, and I think this movie did a good job with it. There is also a story about Dodge's father who apparently abandoned him when he was young and their reconciliation which adds an emotional layer to the film. Dodge and Penny wind up spending their last days together, and I am glad the movie did not back away at the last minute from the end of the world. The last scene, I thought, was particularly well done. The romance may not be entirely believable, but I am inclined to suspend my disbelief for this movie, since I think the rest of the movie works so well.I think the movie might also be viewed as a meditation on what is really important in life. There are so many people hanging on to things (jobs, relationships, old wounds, etc.) that they are not really happy with. This movie, by forcing people to decide how they want to spend their last three weeks, also forces them to decide what is important to them. There is a scene on the beach, where a group of strangers have gathered and are just having a good time, that I think makes a point also made in Ecclesiastes ""All is vanity. So eat, drink, and be merry"" (I am paraphrasing). We all return to dust, so there is nothing to do but enjoy life. That seems to me, anyways, to be one of the messages of the movie.I have to say, the only thing that really mystified me about the movie (I remind everyone my SPOILER ALERT is in effect) was the decision to have the asteroid hit a week earlier than expected. It seems ridiculous to think that the scientists would have been off by a week. I could understand if it served some purpose in the plot but, as far as I can tell, it does not. So why ask the viewer to believe something so implausible if there is no purpose? If anyone can shed some light on this particular aspect of the movie I would love to hear it. It is not really a big deal. It certainly did not ruin the movie for me. I just do not understand it.In summary, I will say that I think this is one of the better movies I have seen in awhile. It has quite a few laughs, but has a serious side as well. It is a sad story, but avoids getting overly heavy. If this movie had just been a comedy I do not think I would have liked it as much, and if it had just been a sad love story I also do not think I would have liked it nearly as much, but the combination worked just right for me. Perhaps it will work just right for you as well...","10 30, 2012",Struck just the right chord for me...,1351555200,MovieTV

"UPDATE:I've completely changed my mind on this battery.  I wish I had never purchased it.  After a couple months, the battery had difficulty holding a full charge.  It became unreliable.  Plus, it very difficult to remove, and I damaged my MacBook trying to remove it.  I recommend putting a thin ribbon under the battery to help you pull it out if necessary.  However, my real recommendation is to not buy this battery.  I apologize to anyone who bought this battery based on my original review (below) and is not happy with it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have a 2007 MacBook Pro (""MacBookPro3,1""), which is known to destroy batteries every 12 months.  Indeed, I've had this battery replaced with an official Apple battery three times, once every 10-14 months.  Each time, the Apple store tech would take pity on me and give me a new battery for free.  I tried every trick in the book to extend battery life, but none of it helped.  A friend who has a MacBookPro4,1 is still using his original Apple battery, which is now almost four years old.  So there's definitely something wrong with this model of laptop.Once again, my battery died in December 2011, but I was unable to get a free replacement this time.  I would purchase an official Apple battery if I thought that it would last four years, but I know that it won't.Based on the other reviews, I took a chance and purchased this battery.  Since there are so many third-party knock-off batteries, it's important to specify the exact brand and vendor of the battery.  I purchased mine from ""BrainyDeal"", and I received a box that said ""AGPTEK"" on it.The battery arrived half-charged, which I think is normal.  CoconutBattery says that its maximum charge is 5000 mAh.  New Apple batteries are supposed to have 5400 mAh, so this battery already only at 92%.  I'm okay with that.  As long as it lasts at least a year, I'll consider it a success.  I don't use this laptop that much, and I rarely use it unplugged anyway.The battery fits just fine in the laptop.  As others have commented, it doesn't pop out properly when unlatched, and it's not completely flush with the bottom.  It juts out maybe 1/32nd of an inch, which is barely noticeable.  My laptop has small rubber feet, so the battery doesn't touch the table surface anyway.  The battery button is glossy instead of matte, but it shows the proper power level when pressed.It also came with a two-foot USB extension cable (male on one end, female on the other).  I have no idea why, as it's not used for anything.  Perhaps it has some value on some PCs, and so it's included with all batteries.I will post periodic updates to this review during the months ahead.  So far, I'm extremely happy with this battery.","01 13, 2012","Was great at first, but not any more",1326412800,Electronics

"I went in wanting it like this movie, I really did. For the record, I'm a white woman, and I really like the ""Rocky"" films. Having been assaulted by my former partner, I knew exactly how Stallone's character felt when he said ""the next morning's the worst,' and I can sure attest to that. I watched all six movies while locked into a hyperbaric chamber twenty times over the course of a month, from the metabolic holes in my head from the abuse on SPECT scan.., a very expensive month, too, since insurance paid for NONE of it. Which was well over 7,500. And I have good insurance! I was landed on my head by my hair onto a tile floor. You can see in the SPECTs right where I hit the floor. In answer to your question, no, they do the 'nice guy bit' until they think they have you, and then they start to turn on you in what starts out looking like 'just a bad day.'No abusive man goes out with a woman he wants to impress and calls here a horrible name at dinner on their first date, and slaps her in the face, it's more like the frog boiling to death in the gradually heated water. A frog won't sit in boiling water, he jumps out!So, my personal experience correlates to the humble, nice guy in a bad spot--ie Rocky. Who if you'll notice gets his butt kicked by bigger and bigger guys in each film. I could relate to that, also. I can't stand arrogance, ""I'm the greatest"" never fails to bother me. Because it's naive, someone, especially in sports, will eventually win out over you. I didn't like this character. Arrogance doesn't seem to be a Muslim value, is it? Note in the second Rocky movie, Paulie suggests that if Adrian was acting up, knock her teeth out. Rocky says, ""Well, you know I kinda like her teeth where they are.' You never specifically hear an anti domestic abuse message in the movies.I dislike movies where the sex is gratuitous, namely because it gives people the idea that you can use people and have no consequences, when that's not at all the case. I don't like when women are like Kleenex, disposable and replaceable. I got that from the trailer alone, and I wasn't looking forward to the movie for that.Even in the later films when Rocky did the 'homeboy' thing, which struck me as odd, considering he's a white boy, and it's bizarrely out of place on someone who had to be 45 at the time of the movie. I put up with it, because there were some nice scenes, even as far gone as ""Rocky Balboa,' the scenes where they do the Adrian tour, and that he didn't just hop into bed with that girl. even the meat locker scene about the 'stuff in the basement' was interesting.Part of why the character was an icon is because he gave a lot of people someone to emulate, and to look up to, which you sure don't get here. I wish you did. I was sincerely hoping for it. Remember, the original film was in 1976, when I was small, and the country needed someone to have as their hero.  Vietnam was just wrapping up, the muscle cars were pretty much gone, a casualty of combined astronomical gas prices, and insurance. We didn't have a heck of a lot to look forward to as a country.I wish this could have given us another icon or character to emulate and admire.I love the Rocky films because I was sincerely hoping for that here, a sincere, honest man, just trying to do his best, who loved his wife sincerely, wasn't treating her like a stray dog you can kick as you choose (and I love dogs)  and wasn't cheating on her with every woman in sight, full of skeeze we don't really need to see. He couldn't even beat guys up as a 'collector.' Frankly, I hope we get a chance to someday see another character like that again. But then, it's only been 36 years!  Also, Burgess Meredeth was brilliant as the old trainer.I only had those hope for this movie. I'm sorry I was disappointed.","01 1, 2012",where is zero stars?,1325376000,MovieTV

"This is a Great set period.  If you're looking for a great High Quality Mouse and Keyboard this is The set for you.  The Software is easy to use, and has all of the settings in the control panel, but easy to change in your windows notification area. I really like the battery meter in mouse tab its kind of nice to know that I have 1100 days left on my mouse, all be it a bit out rageous. The software has a gaming mode, to turn off all of these buttons when it detects a game; it also lets you reprogram these buttons, as macros.  The mouse is fits my hand nicely, I like the weight of the mouse with the batteries installed, it glides nicely. I like the placement of the forward and back buttons it is laid out just like $50 gaming mouse. People who reviewed the mouse who marked it negatively because of the buttons, in my opinion have never used them.  At first I found these buttons hard to use and annoying but after about a week I got use to them.  The one that My gaming mouse did not have is the ""Application button"", That brings up the areo glass window selector, I like it Kind of hard to press on accident I feel, but annoying when you do.  I do not know the DPI of this mouse, or polling on this mouse, but it seems to be pretty responsive. I Marked my movement on the of my gaming mouse, which has a DPI of 2000. Both mice moved the pointer the same distance in the screen as they did in real life. I would say the DPI is pretty High on the mouse but that is just a guess, I have found anywhere from 1000 to 3400 DPI online, I Kind of think its about  100 DPI.  I like the mouse wheel lock,  when it is disengaged the mouse scroll is nice, it is weighted just right and it scrolls for a very long time.What first struck me about this keyboard was the LCD screen, which is not quit as cpol as it first looked. It is really nice though don't get me wrong.  At first I thought the key's were a bit junky and cheap, they kind of had that feel, but after using them a bit they are nice. They feel really nice on my fingers, they press nice and quietly, and are a bit rounded.  The hand rest is nice Pleather, and is a nice touch. IT has the standard media buttons, volume controls, and pause/play, and Skip/forward.  It even has some Function buttons like a laptop would.  Email, Work Excel, search, zoom UP/down ect...  I really like those.  It also has a calculator button.  Most importantly you can remap all the FN and calculator buttons using the software.The last thing I wanted to talk about with these is range.  I set my laptop up by my TV, and got all the way to my Kitchen about 20 to 30 Ft away on both devices.  The signal even past through a refrigerator and a wall with both devices.  Placement of USB receiver can limit performance, so it came with a usb Extension cord. Not the cheap ones that are silver, but a nice one that has a little Logitech logo, and ""base"" .  If you find you can't get good range move the receiver away from the back of your computer, especially if you have a clear side panel on your computer as they leak a lot of RF interference.Final thoughts:Good quality mouse and Keyboard. The lack of technical specs on mouse and most likely a low DPI on the mouse  in a set that cost this much is why this gets 4 out of 5.  Sersiously like 400 to 600 more DPI this would have been a kick ass entry level  gaming set. With complements on feel of mouse, mouse scroll wheel and unlocked scrolling, Quality and feel of keyboard,  and great battery life and range on both devices.","07 8, 2012","Great Set, not quite on par for hard core gaming",1341705600,Electronics

"The Crow: City of Angels is really a 4 star rating not a 5 but I am giving it that because the customer reviews were weak. I love the first Crow, It was a very dark adaptation of the comic which featured awesome acting and great action, and gory kills. The Crow: City of Angels was dismissed as a cash in right off the bat when it was announced, People thought it was a disgrace to the late Brandon Lee(R.I.P) which is understandable but City of Angels really is a good film. I have not seen The Crow: Salvation or The Crow: Wicked Prayer yet but I especially heard Wicked Prayer is the worst of the series.Plot: Ashe Corven(Vincent Perez) and his Son as they witness a gang murder a guy, The gang then kills Ashe and his son and Ashe gets resurrected by a crow and becomes The Crow to get revenge on the gang that killed him and his son. Sounds almost like the first one and the plot is near the first one but it is not the same. Iggy Pop gives a good performance as one of the gang members as well as a young Thomas Jane. Vincent Perez is good as well but of course not better than the great Brandon Lee. Mia Kirshner plays a older Sarah in the film and does a good job.DVD: Warning, Get the Collector Series DVD if you plan on buying City of Angels, Do not get the Miramax DVD released a couple of years ago or the Blu-Ray put out a couple years ago because the picture quality on the Collector Series DVD is better and it has a ton of features, The recent Miramax releases have no features.Overall: If you do not compare City of Angels to the first one, You may enjoy it. I love this film and I know I am in the minority of that but if you go into it with an open mind, I think you will appreciate being its own film.","12 7, 2013",Highly Underrated Sequel To A Great Film,1386374400,MovieTV

"Why is this mouse great?  Firstly it is Bluetooth, meaning if your computer supports it, you don't have to plug in a USB wireless transmitter.  That is HUGE.  My Macbook Air (2013) only has two USB ports so if one was taken up by the mouse it would leave only one other for my DSP or backup drive or whatever.The mouse is smaller than I thought, which is not a problem but note that it does not fit in the palm of the hand.  If you hold it that way you must curl your fingers quite a bit (90 degrees at the knuckle).  I use it in my fingers instead, and it works well that way.The instructions don't tell you how to replace the battery, but after experimentation, i pried the top plastic panel off, and saw the batteries.  Not that you have to replace them often, according to HP.One last ""pro"" is that it works on my white melamine desk from IKEA, unlike the budget logitech corded mouse I have, whose laser wont pick up the desk as a ""surface""Update after a few weeks:Still happy with the mouse.  On wake-up from sleep it re-pairs with Macbook Air quickly (2-3 sec.).  I'm used to the small size (I wear a ML glove) but some may find it too small.  It travels very well due to its small size and lack of the need for the mini transmitter that non-bluetooth mice need.","02 11, 2014",Great initial impression,1392076800,Electronics

It was a lot of fun!  As other reviewers have said, it is truly ""over the top"", and has a graphic novel feeling to it, likeSin City (Two-Disc Theatrical & Recut, Extended, and Unrated Versions) [Blu-ray] and300 (Two-Disc Special Edition), including enough blood to fill a couple of swimming pools.  It has some very graphic images that are, perhaps for the best, rarely seen on TV, such as heads cut in half horizontally and vertically where the quite vivid images seem to be anatomically correct. There is some great fight choreography, likeKill Bill, Vols. 1 & 2. And, it has as much nudity and sex asCaligula (Unrated Edition)-- altho of considerably softer core.  And, yet, I feel that it is actually giving a fairly decent flavor of what living during these times might have been like, asRome: The Complete Seriesdid.  I think it will kill a lot of romantic notions of how much fun it might have been to live then.  Much more fun to watch than live it.

"** A little history (or ""Why not to buy an OCZ SSD"") **I started my foray into SSD drives with an OCZ Agility 3 60GB. The first thing I noticed was the lightning-fast speed, followed by the silent operation. I was in love. Then came the freezing, the blue screens of death, the endless firmware updates that didn't fix anything, and I was disappointed. Unfortunately, I had grown to love the speed of the drive (ringing in a 7.3 Windows Experience Index score was nothing to sneeze at). A little research revealed that almost EVERYONE with an OCZ SSD drive experienced problems, so I decided to try the well-received Crucial C300.** About the Crucial C300 **Having touched the holy ground of SSD goodness, I decided to buy the Crucial. The price was nightmarish (almost $2 a GB), but I had already come dangerously close to filling the 60GB so, much like a drug addict, I knew I needed more. The drive came, installed easily and booted as fast (or faster) than the OCZ. Then, the stuttering came... almost immediately.What's the stutter? Imagine typing and then every third or fourth word, the computer pauses for a second. This flaw makes the drive TOTALLY unusable. Panicked, I did some research and found that the Crucial stutter issue is just as widespread as OCZ's issues. However, there was a firmware update available that supposedly fixed the issue. I downloaded the firmware from Crucial's site, burned the bootable CD, and rebooted.While the firmware installed, I mournfully prepared the packing material so I could file a defective return with Amazon, fully expecting the firmware not to work.IT WORKED!The drive works flawlessly and scores an even-higher 7.9 out of 7.9 on the Windows Experience Index (guys, I know this isn't as legitimate a benchmark as PCMark or 3DMark, but cut me some slack)!** Why not ready for primetime? **So, why only 4 stars out of 5 and why do I say ""not ready for primetime?"" Disk drives shouldn't REQUIRE a firmware update to work properly. They shouldn't stutter, they shouldn't BSOD, and they shouldn't cost $2/GB. For those of you (like myself) who are ready to sacrifice space and cash for speed and silence, they are excellent, but for the majority of computer users, I would recommend waiting until all of the manufacturers work out their kinks and lower their prices from orbit.** Other Note **SSD drives don't include 3.5""-to-2.5"" adapter kits, so you'll want to pick one of those up, too. I've seen some people tape the drives to their case using duct tape or electrical tape, but that looks kludgey as all get-out. Do yourself a favor, you can get these adapter kits for under $10 from Amazon or other vendors.","08 29, 2011",SSDs are not quite ready for primetime.,1314576000,Electronics

"UPDATE 6/12/2013: I got back into D3 after they released several patches and have improved the game in many aspects. I still find it to be a very enjoyable game and will continue to play it.First off, if you have not played the first two Diablo games, I would strongly recommend playing them. Get use to the gameplay within those because that is what the new Diablo 3 will be like. I have heard many complaints and comments about the game regarding this. If you do not like either of the first two Diablo games, I guarantee you WILL NOT like D3. There you go, I just saved you $60 or $200 (depending if you were going to buy the regular or the CE).Though there are noticeable flaws in the game including the Real-Money Auction house (you can ""buy"" yourself to the top...... whats the fun in that?) as well as no Single-Player Offline mode (better suited for hardcore players and not getting hit by lag spikes which results in lost characters and Blizzard does not take responsiblity on that).What I enjoyed: The story, a similar type of gameplay from the previous versions, updated graphics, but an overall different feel to make Diablo III unique when compared to Diablo I & II.I thought the Collector's Edition was awesome as it does have some pretty nice stuff (especially the art book and the skull).I am tired of hearing negative comments by the ""new"" Diablo players. Bash me if you want to, I don't care. I enjoyed this game. For you new players, just play the first 2 games first, it will make you understand how Diablo III all began. There are other aspects within the game to appreciate and not just the plain ""black & white."" Read between the lines to truly appreciate something.This game truly did receive too much hype. I was one of those who was excited for the game, but I refused to play the beta and I waited patiently for it to arrive. When it did come out, I started slowly on it to appreciate it, not diving into everything and overplaying it. Usually when games get way too much hype, they usually fail miserably. It all depends on how you and you alone act towards the game.But, I must thank those devoted Diablo fans you did appreciate the game (and those who did not and I must respect your valid reasons). I have several friends that do not play it too often (due to not enough time as they are busy), but they do play and enjoy it. They usually contact me when they want to play for an hour, and we do a couple quests (as in not speed running from Point A to Point B). That is how I get the most out of things.Here is my original review that I posted when the game came out:~""As being a long time fan and player of Diablo and Diablo II, I had high expectations for this game. It exceeded everything that I was expecting and I can see myself many years down the road continuing to play this game. After playing through it once, I can see the ""replay-ability"" just like in Diablo II. I will be playing this game for many years.For it being the Collector's Edition, it had some nice items inside. The soundtrack, behind the scenes DVD, guest passes, a vast artbook with stories, and of course the skull with the USB soulstone with the full version of Diablo II and Diablo II Lord of Destruction.Was it worth it? In my opinion, yes it was.Finally I should add, the CE box makes a nice decoration on my desk as well.A+ game!The only downside is that there is no Offline Single Player, which kind of bothers me a bit. I have played through the game by myself to learn the story thoroughly. Though I do have decent internet, I would rather play the game sometimes on my own without having to worry about servers being down and other things like that.""~","05 20, 2012","Great Game, Blizzard Keeps Improving",1337472000,VideoGames

We know blue LEDs exist, you can use the other colors again...That's where my love affair with this little box ended. When I first hooked it up, I tried a blu-ray player and an Ouya console. The blu-ray seemed to work ok, other than a slight delay between the video starting, and the audio starting. Video quality is great, and audio (once it started) was great as well. When I say the audio was delayed, I don't mean that it was out of sync with the video, merely that it cut in a second after the video started.The Ouya was a different story. This game console starts up with the ""Ouya"" logo and a crowd of people shouting ""OUYA"" - well, the video was fine, but there was no audio. The audio didn't start until I was playing a game and a good minute had passed. It worked fine the rest of the evening, so I put it aside until tonight.Tonight, same thing. A *lot* longer audio delay on the blu-ray. No audio at all on the Ouya. No audio on a Rapsberry Pi running OpenELEC. Maybe audio on an older DVD player.

My first impression of the D700 is its capability to produce film like colors and saturation (been using F100 for 10 years). The shutter is quieter than F100 (more like F5) and auto focus tracking is pretty snappy and dead on. ISO1600 and below is no-brainer with great DR and texture.

I got them the next day with one day shipping and they sound great! the volume on my ipod is not as loud as i like but maybe i'm losing my hearing (lol i'm 17)! But other than that they are cute and sound great! But if you have the option to get the HD 202 get those!,"01 23, 2013",2nd best headphone i ever had!,1358899200,Electronics
"Powerbanks are usually not what I&#8217;d describe as &#8220;fun&#8221; things to play with, but this one comes pretty close mainly due to it&#8217;s novel way to display the remaining charge: you give the powerbank a shake, and the LED gas gauge lights up (1 to 4 lights that indicate charge level). It takes a conventional feature and makes it a bit fun to use.It also handles the practical basics very well. The overall design is well thought-out, with attached cables for micro USB and Lightning connections. That&#8217;s a very helpful feature since I&#8217;m always forgetting to bring cables along. This ensures you won&#8217;t be left high and dry for lack of a cable.The build quality is solid, with tight seams and well-anchored ports. Visually it looks nice as well, with an all-black case with bright red attached cables. It&#8217;s flat on the base and stands up on all sides without any wobble.The 8400mAh rating is more than adequate for a couple of phone recharges or a full tablet recharge. It&#8217;s not the highest capacity out there, but the size/performance is a nice middle ground &#8211; this measures about 2.5 inches wide and 4.5 inches tall, making it pretty easy to take along.Zero complaints about performance, and appreciate the thoughtful design (and the ability to shake it!). Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]","02 20, 2014",Practical powerbank with a shake-to-see charge indicator,1392854400,Electronics
"I never thought I could get this kind of performance with a DX crop sensored camera !  I shot with the D300s for 2years and was pleased how I learned to get more out of that camera than most people thought possible . I own many DX lenses and  2 FX lenses . I don't shoot video so this review may not be for you ?  I was contemplating switching to a full frame body like a D700 or an D 800e. I knew it was going to be pricey if I did go full frame because of the glass I would have to buy to accompany the camera . I was getting ready to sell all my DX equipment on eBay when a friend recommend I shoot with his 7100 for an afternoon before I abandoned my superior collection of DX lenses ! Boy am I happy I took him up on that offer ! I was stunned at the quality of the photos I took with his D7100. The dynamic range and sharpness of the photos I took were absolutly fantastic ! I wasted no time ordering one of my own and since I received it I've been stunned at how big of a difference there is between my D300s and the D7100 ! I thought I could only achieve this kind of result with a full frame sensor . I'll never sell my DX set up now that I've achieved results like this. Sure I'll still buy a D800e down the road but I'm in no hurry now. I've been envious of friends who have full frame camera's because of the obvious difference in dynamic range and sharpness they were realizing compared to myself. Not anymore ! I realize all the practice I had getting the most out of my D300s made me a great photographer and my composition skills were actually better than most of my friends who own full frame camera's. With photoshop I can stitch together panoramic wide shots that blow away most anything I've seen ! The low light performance is great and the focus system on the D7100 is second to none ! With the price of FX lenses being so insanely over priced ,I'm thrilled I bought this wonderful DX camera ! I know I'll go to a car show and see people with their pro body camera's thinking they have the advantage when taking the same shots I am. But I'll be thinking I could have bought 3 or 4 more of my complete setups for what they paid for a full frame camera and a couple of lenses while achieving little to no better result than I get with my D7100. Don't anyone think that a crop sensor camera can't compete with a full frame sensor again. Thanks Nikon , you created a game changer !","12 8, 2013",One very dynamic crop sensor camera !,1386460800,Electronics
"To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare, the choreographer Frederick Ashton (of whom I am a great fan) decided to make a short one act ballet telling the story of the play A Midsummer Nights Dream. He used the incidental music and vocal score composed by Felix Mendelssohn (arranged by John Lanchbery) for a production of the play in the mid-1800s. The ballet Ashton produced is compact, effective and great fun to watch. It was premiered on April 2, 1964 at Covent Garden, London with Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley as Oberon and Titania. It became very popular with many revivals in London and is performed by many companies world wide. The one on the present disc was made in 2004 for PBS TV series called Dance in America and performed by the American Ballet Theatre group.This is a readily approached, story-ballet that is entertaining to watch and easy to understand. The stars and the corps do an excellent job of relating the plot. The Queen Titania of Alessandra Ferri is dainty and feminine and dances very well. She is not imperious as Titanias tend to be. The Oberon of Ethan Stiefel is a wonder to behold. He is not only and awesome dancer but an excellent mime of an actor as well. He is a glorious performer. Also of glorious technique is the Puck of Herman Cornejo. Sprightly, agile, energetic, superb placement - you could go on and on in describing his dancing. The lovers were well played as was the ruffians and the ass Bottom; a fun bit. The orchestra named here as the Pacific Symphony Orchestra was competently led by Ormsby Wilkins. He never let the pace slacken as this is a fast paced action ballet with no melodrama but is filled with wit and humor.I enjoyed this production very much and love seeing this ballet again and again. As you know there is another, earlier ballet of the same story and music as choreographed by George Balanchine. His version was made for the New York City ballet company in 1962. It is longer and more filled out and I think a greater work of art. The production done some years ago by the Pacific Northwest Ballet is superb. Though this present disc is most enjoyable, the Balanchine remains my favorite.Though some reviewers complained about the film making process, I found it quite adequate.It is great fun and great entertainment.","06 15, 2014",Great Fun with Great Dancers,1402790400,CDVinyl

"I have other lens cap retainers and they usually are secured by shoelace-type thicker strings.  That makes them easy to remove from your camera or strap or wherever you loop-tie it.  This, however, is very thin and almost impossible to find and untie/unloop from the camera or strap where it is secured.  Since I change lenses often with different size lens caps, this is a headache to me when using this one.  I don't like the ones that fasten onto the lens cap with adhesive, so this type of cap keeper is the best idea--but not this one in particular because of the flimsy string.  I will try to replace it as soon as possible, as it is currently in such a snarl on my strap that I can't untangle it.  I will likely cut it off and discard it.  I would highly recommend that, unless you only have one size lens cap and never intend to remove the cap and keeper, that you avoid this lens cap.

"I had used over 50 of these Sony DPR85RS2H to record with good success. One coaster because I could see the disc had bad coating even before I tried to record on it. I bought these from Honolulu-based Japan-owned retail store for $11.99 for a ten pack. Then they ran out and asked for more. The store said they will get more stock and recently the ten packs went on sale again. Same blue packaging, but these made in India Sony discs now seem to have high percentage of defects. When I first took the blank disc out I did not like the ""look"" of the coating. It looked inconsistent with a narrow ring of differing reflectivity near the outer edge. Same ""differing reflectivity"" on all ten discs. Although burning took place, the disc could not be finalized and got rejected by the recorder. It looks like a manufacturing quality control problem.

"True Green Lantern fans may be a bit disappointed over the changes from the comic version but it is an entertaining movie. I think the casting was decent, certainly better than Spiderman. I think Ryan Reynolds did a fine job and was believable in the role and the rest the cast did pretty well too. Good special effects and plenty of eye candy make it worth seeing.When a Green Lantern dies their ring chooses another to take their place. When a human is chosen there is skepticism among the older races as to whether the human can live up to the high standards of the protectors known as the Green Lanterns. When a creature composed of fear begins killing races and even Green Lanterns. It is up to them to stop it before it consumes everyone.The only real disappointment I had was to find out Warner Brothers charged me for a Ultraviolet copy that is not on the DVD and that it will require me to install software I don't necessarily want to access a website ran by them. No offense but how does that help me when I don't have access to the internet on a trip or when they have maintenance periods, et cetera.

"I tell you people I forgot just how good this album really was. Back when it first came out I had not purchased a CD player (young and didn't save money very efficiently)  so I had this on cassette. Fast forward almost 20 odd years and I now have 600 CD players strung through two houses and a multitude of vehicles (an exageration of course) I happen upon it on Amazon and think to myself, yeah, I think that was good if memory serves me. So I buy it and I can say that with out a doubt this is a great little album.The thing is that it lacks some of the ""polish"" of certain studio recordings but those little nuances make this more of a boutique album from the late great ""Nineties Seattle Sludge"" that was grunge.River of Decepit tells a tale for what I am sure is a page torn right from the book of Layne Staley's short and ultimately tragic life. He was a fantastic singer and songwriter. He knew just how to captivate his audience. His lyrics were like ""Junkie Poetry"" Don't get me wrong, I don't condone the lifestyle or the self destructiveness that usually accompanies being a junkie and their lives are far from poetic but he seemed to almost be telling cautionary tales of woe because he was living it right then and there.This album, for Layne, is a somewhat softer side and tonealy different from his Alice In Chains offerings. Let's not forget that Mike McCready (of Pearl Jam fame)Barrett Martin (Screaming Trees)and John Baker Saunders (The Walkabouts) were the other major driving forces behind this album. That's quite a pedigree to have on one album. I guess I always loved the comradery that the Seattle bands seemed to have with one another and they all seemed happy for their contemporaries successes.The first 5 songs are in my opinion the best. Only 5 you say, well think of it like this, how many musicians would kill for 5 hit songs on one album? I tell you how many . . . All of them.Wake up - The sting of a love affair gone sour, X-ray Mind - The slow burn of distrust, River of Decepit - I believe it is self decepit, I'm Above - a great punk vibe, Artificial Red - a Slow blues fueled A** KickerYou'll likely never hear much music like this again and sadly two of the four men here are dead, due to heavy drug use and the overdoses that accompanied both of their last trips. R. I. P. Layne and J.B. and if you liked ninties grunge, here you go, in a very pure form from 4 vastly different influences ""Mad Season"" ABOVE.","02 22, 2012",Seattle Sludge,1329868800,CDVinyl
"I purchased my Zune HD in December 2009, and few months after it was released. I was debating at the time whether to get that or the iPod Touch 3G, and I ultimately decided on the Zune HD because of the HD radio and that I like Microsoft products. Since then, I have purchased an iPod Touch 4G which I use as my PDA, but my faithful Zune HD is carried in my pocket and used for music and podcasts. I will give this review based on my 2+ years of experience with the device.DESIGNMicrosoft really hit a homerun with the design. It is a basic slim model that tapers on the right and left edges. The back is made of aluminum, and the screen is covered with gorilla glass. The screen itself is an OLED screen and the colors are very vibrant, much better than a regular LCD screen. There is a single Home button on the front. The left side has a media button for opening the media control menu which features play/pause, forward/reverse, and volume control. The top has a power button, and the bottom has the 30-pin USB port and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.The headphones it comes with are not the best though. Sound quality is rather mediocre, a little worse than the iPod earbuds. I found the earpieces a little too big, but Microsoft does include three foam covers of different colors: blue, pink, and black.The cable is top quality, much better than the iPod/iPad/iPhone cable. It feels solid and still works even after taking a beating the past couple years.MEDIA FEATURESThis device was designed mainly for media consumption, so I'll start my software review there. The Zune HD's music manager is the best I have ever seen. The metro interface (similar to what is being used now on the Windows Phones and Windows 8) separates the music into categories based on Playlist, Artist, Song, Album, and Genre. All categories are arranged in alphabetical order and items can be easily found by pressing the letter icon and selecting the first letter of the song/album/artist/etc that you're looking for.The media player itself is really nice. Controls are easily accessible by tapping on the Now Playing screen or with the media button. The only downside is that there are no dedicated volume controls, but that has not been too big of an inconvenience for me. What is really nice is the screensaver that plays while songs are playing. The screensaver scrolls the name of the song and artist and the album cover, all on top of a background picture of the artist. It's a pretty attractive feature.Most of the features are hard to explain in writing, but I personally have used the classic scroll-wheel iPod, iPod Touch, and seen a few Android players, and I have never seen a music manager as good as the Zune HD's.The other main feature of this device is the HD Radio. I can get the regular FM radio stations in my city as well as the high-quality HD stations. Some stations such as STAR 100.7 has 3 HD channels; HD1 that plays the regular programming, HD2 that plays older hits, and HD3 which carries the local news radio station. All HD channels have CD-quality. It is nice to have all these free stations with high-quality audio. Plus, I am able to listen to all the sports games in town even when I don't have an active internet connection. The iPod Touch still doesn't have an FM radio, so the Zune HD is much better than it here.INTERNETThe Zune HD features Internet Explorer Mobile 6.0. The browser is OK, but sometimes the occasional page does not load. It is certainly slower than an iPod Touch or Android device, but it gets the job done. Mobile webpages work best. The major downside is that it does not have flash, so you cannot watch Youtube on it. So, the browser is really only good for basic stuff (Facebook, email, ESPN, reference, etc).The other important factor is that the Zune HD does not support WPA/WPA2-Enterprise, so you will not be able to use it at most schools or businesses. Also, I cannot seem to get it to connect to the browser-based 802.11n login at my university, so I'm not sure if this thing is even compatible with an 802.11n connection (it only has a 802.11g WIFI chip).APPSThe Zune is very limited when it comes to apps, but it does have some useful ones. For practical use, it features Facebook, Twitter, Calculator, Email, Calendar, and MSN Weather apps to name a few. There are some decent games too like Project Gotham Racing, Audiosurf, Tiki Totems, Vans Sk8: Pool Service, Lucky Lanes Bowling, Solitaire, Chess, and Checkers to name a few. I actually enjoy the games on the Zune HD more than the ones I can find for my iPod Touch. While the app selection is extremely limited (there are currently 62 apps total), the nice thing is that all of them are free. And, some of the free apps are actually paid versions for the iPod Touch and Android. So, it is a nice bonus to have.CONTENTThis is another important factor with a music player. The Zune Marketplace has just about everything in it. I do not buy for there (I use Amazon MP3), but from what I can see in the store, the selection appears complete. It also has movies and TV shows. The one downside is with the podcasts. The selection is quite limited compared to what is in the iTunes Store. But, the good thing is that you can manually add the Podcast link in the Zune software. Which brings me to my next point.ZUNE SOFTWAREThe Zune software is the best music software I have used, hands down. It is fast, clean, and lets me organize my music quickly. It is much better than buggy and complicated iTunes. Further, since Zune software is integrated with the Libraries feature on Windows 7, whatever you put into your library folders automatically gets added to the Zune software. So, if I download a new MP3, I can just put it in my Music library folder, and Zune automatically detects it and adds it to my library. With iTunes, I always have to manually add everything, so Zune is much more convenient.The other nice feature of the Zune software is that it allows guest Zune devices. So, if my friend brings his Zune and plugs it into my computer, the Zune software will recognize it as a different device and allow it as a guest and let me copy songs to it. iTunes only allows one iDevice at a time, so Zune is much better.OVERALL IMPRESSIONMy first MP3 player was an iPod Nano 2G. After many frustrations with the iTunes Store policies, I bailed on Apple and gave the Zune HD a try. I am very glad I did and plan to use this device for as long as its available. It is the best player I have used and there is no other device like it on the market; even the latest Samsung Galaxy Player only has a regular FM radio and no HD Radio. The interface is much better than Apple's offerings, and it's a shame Microsoft never marketed this device more to the public. If you are looking for a device for PDA purposes, I would strongly advise to go with the Galaxy Player or the iPod Touch. However, if you mainly want a device for music and radio, the Zune HD is still the best device even though Microsoft stopped production of it.","04 27, 2012",Best media player and HD radio with internet/apps as bonus!,1335484800,Electronics

"Jackie Chan has always been a great physical comedian. Every film I've seen him in has been great fun to watch, but even though his films are watched by whole families who love him, I don't believe he had done a film that was intended as a family comedy. Until now. Chan and his associates have taken a classic Jules Verne story and given it their own little twist. The end result is just plain silly fun with the trademark martial arts comedy we come to expect in a Jackie Chan movie, along with engaging and likeable characters and some very big laughs.Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan, a legendary TV star in the UK) is an inventor considered by Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent)to be a crackpot, believing everything that can be done has been. Fogg needs a valet to test his latest invention that will allow a man to break a 50mph speed barrier. In drops Lou Xiang (Jackie Chan), a Chinese man who has robbed the Bank of England for a priceless Buddha; a warlord and her team called The Black Scorpions stole it from China. By hiding in Fogg's property and testing his new invention he is able to elude the British police. The test proves successful (more or less), but Kelvin and the other Royal Academy of Science members refuse to accept his results. Fogg tells them how it would be easy for the bank thief to get to China, and predicts that he could go around the world in exactly 80 days. A wager his arranged. If Fogg succeeds, he will take over the Royal Academy. If he fails, he gives up everything he owns and his career as an inventor. Xiang immediately sees this as his way to get back to China and return the Buddha.Off they go, beginning with a boat trip to Paris, where Chan winds up fighting the Black Scorpions, and the two pick up a French artist Monique (Cecile French). Like Fogg, she is considered a crackpot as well, and believes she will be inspired to create a fantastic piece of work if she joins them. The journey continues through Turkey, India, China, San Francisco, The U.S. Continent, New York, and finally across the Atlantic.It is during this journey that AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS follows what seems to be a tradition in film adaptions of the book. The 1956 film had the most celebrity cameos for its time, including Frank Sinatra. Same thing with this version, and some of them result in a number of big laughs. The biggest ones come in Turkey where they are ordered to join Prince Hapi (Arnold Schwarzenegger). This cameo is one of the funniest roles I've seen Schwarzenegger play. He is making fun of himself as the legendary bodybuilder, especially involving a statue of him. (It is ironic that a real statue of Schwarzenegger was unveiled recently, even though I felt it should've resembled the one in this movie.) Other cameos include Owen and Luke Wilson as the Wright Brothers (the first time I think they actually played brothers), Mark Addy as a freighter captain, Rob Schneider as a bum, Chan's old friend Sammo Hung as a legendary Chinese folk hero, and another funny performance by that character actress Kathy Bates. (I won't spoil the fun by telling you what she plays.)And all the way through the movie, there is the amazing physical humor and utter likeability of Jackie Chan. He and his stunt team are professionals, and know exactly what they are doing in the action scenes. At one point in the movie Jackie demonstrates his singing ability and even that is good for a laugh. I know that Chan had been trained to sing during those 10 years in the Chinese Opera school, so I wasn't surprised to see him do it in this film.(note) This was the first time I saw Steve Coogan, and he has continued to make me laugh in the recent films he did: TROPIC THUNDER, and HAMLET 2.","11 3, 2011",A fun family film with Jackie Chan,1320278400,MovieTV
"Just purchased this bundle in September 2011 & was received within a week - fast delivery.  Here's my review:Battery grip - the look & feel is the same as the canon battery grip. No problem with it & it made my camera (Canon T1i) look like a professional camera. Based on the negative reviews, I don't see any problem with it so far & it doesn't look cheap. it also included cartridge to put 6 AA batteries - awesome!2 LP-E5 batteries - one battery is 1800 mAh - higher than the canon battery bundled with my camera (1000 mAh only). This will last longer.Wireless remote - works perfectly with my camera but you have to point it on the side were the IR is visible otherwise it will not work. At 15 feet it works perfectly.Battery charger - fits the batteries but have not fully maximixed the used of it.

"The Apple iPad 3's screen is terrific, but I returned mine, in favor of keeping my Touchpad.  The 3 is a little lighter & thinner, but after 5 minutes holding each, you really don't notice it.  Both tablets are well-made and feel solid. The performance specs are essentially the same. The iPad 3's processor may be faster, but that speed it taken up making the screen run smoothly.  So too is the battery, especially when you watch a video.The Touchpad's battery lasts a good bit longer while playing a movie, and there's no discernible difference when watching HD.  I'm also a fan of WebOS, and wish more main-stream app developers including Netflix & Adobe, would provide apps for it.  Running multiple apps on WebOS is a breeze and makes iOS & Android look clunky.  If you want to buy a new book, Kindle's iOS app forces you to quit the app and launch the Kindle Store off the [...]  This was annoying, when Kindle on WebOS has a link that takes you directly to the store.But what ultimately sold me on keeping the Touchpad were its stereo speakers & Beats Audio.  I wasn't born with ear buds like kids today, but if you want decent audio, the iPad 3's crummy external speaker forces you to plug your ears up.  With a $500-800 tablet this seems absurd.The kicker is you can run Android Ice Cream Sandwich along with WebOS, giving you plenty of options for apps.  Just Google, and you'll find instructions on how to get ICS on your Touchpad.  Not a Techie?  Go to eBay!  Search for HP Touchpads and you'll also people offering to do it for as little as $20.  In less than a week, I was watching Netflix on my Touchpad, and I'm about to download Adobe's expanded Photoshop app.I got my 32 gig Touchpad new at the $159 fire sale, and have no regrets.

"I was force to see this movie the first weekend that it came out, and I was disappointed; I saw the original play, and wasn't greatly impressed with it, but seeing the movie, I enjoyed the popcorn. Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore gave poor performances; Of course, Tyler Perry playing three roles simultaneously was just as bad and I despise him; Cicely Tyson, of course, gave a disgraceful performance  helping her daughter become more whorish even though she herself has been wronged; I have heard the bad and the wrost about this movie; I have heard that Madea is just another stereotypical role model that we need to get away from; let's be honest, very little of us can attest to a Madea in our family? or know a man that dresses like a woman? This was one movie that sex and profanity splashed forward and yet, the critics my people loved it; Yes, I found it a bad movie, and can all of those who supported Mr Perry opening weekend be wrong? I think so; Look forward to the day the Jesus comes down from heaven and kills any man who is dress like a woman.""Deu 22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so [are] abomination unto the LORD thy God."".....P.S don't watch this movie true children of God","11 22, 2012",hell no,1353542400,MovieTV

"TYRANNOSAUR offers a bleak picture of life in contemporary Britain.  Joseph (Peter Mullan) is unemployed, with a tendency towards violence, who has contributed in no small part to his wife's early death (the Tyrannosaur of the title refers to his widow).  He encounters Hannah (Olivia Colman), a middle-class woman working in a local charity shop, who offers to redeem him through prayer; initially he rejects the offer, but as the film unfolds he gradually becomes more and more involved with her.  Hannah has as bleak a life as Joseph, having to cope with a violent husband (Eddie Marsan), who eventually rapes her.  She stays at Joseph's house, and the two of them form a relationship, even though neither of them can disclose their feelings.  Deliberately shot in washed-out colors, TYRANNOSAUR suggests that people are imprisoned by their existences, whether they are working- or middle-class.  The only hope of 'redemption' - which is perhaps too optimistic a word - is to trust in one another, and even then, the redemption might be only temporary or partial.  This is what Joseph and Hannah discover at the end, even if their meetings are only sporadic.  Paddy Considine's film is not for the fainthearted; the language is extreme, and there are violent scenes throughout.  It is well written, even though there are one or two implausibilities; at one point Joseph kills a neighbor's dog, who has previously mauled the child Sam (Samuel Bottomley).  Normally any dog would have been put down by the authorities after such an incident has occurred.  Nonetheless this low-budget film has a powerful effect.","01 19, 2014",Bleak Picture of Contemporary Life in an Unnamed Northern British City,1390089600,MovieTV

"When I'm at home, I set up my MacBook Pro like a desktop computer, with an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor. I'm currently using a newer Macbook, which has a Thunderbolt/Minidisplay video output. My elderly Viewsonic monitor worked well for many months with a DVI cable connected to a Minidisplay adapter. Sadly, the old Viewsonic died a couple of weeks ago, so based on strong recommendations on Amazon and C-Net, I decided to replace it with the HP x2301.Oops.I'll spare you the gyrations I went through trying to get any signal from the Macbook to the monitor (although, hint, I got nowhere with the DVI cable -- I had to use an HDMI cable, which was not included in the box, to get anywhere at all). In the end, it sort of worked -- as long as I kept the menu on the laptop screen. When I set up the display preferences so that the menus appeared on the external monitor, where I wanted them, and then restarted the Macbook, the monitor became unresponsive.If you're looking for a PC monitor, this may be a great option for you.

"This is the second IPAD case that I've owned with a keyboard inside.  Aside from that, I've gone through a few other cases, each of which had its advantages and disadvantages.  Before I get wound up, I have an IPAD 2, so anything that may be specific to an IPAD 3 I cannot comment on.The first case that I had with a keyboard was one that I purchased from Brookstone. It was a faux leather case and it was pretty handy, certainly handier than lugging around the Apple keyboard.  The only problem is that the keyboard broke after 6 months and I had to discard the cover and kb.This Belkin case has a slimmer profile, mostly because it is more a slip cover than an actual case.  In the Brookstone case, it had a plastic mount specifically for holding the Ipad.  This case, you slip the IPAD in, train the keyboard (connect it to the Ipad through Bluetooth) and you're good to go.Pros:The case is completely functional.  The keyboard is smooth and quiet (that's important and it is a clear fault of the Apple keyboard, enough that I've taken notes and caught nasty looks from people who didn't want to listen to me taking notes), tested fine (every key worked perfectly at least at present) and the case itself could be cocked to two different angles. To be fair, only one angle is possible while using the keyboard.  The second, more oblique angle, is probably only meant to be used for media viewing.  The keyboard is firmly secured to the case with velcro.The case has holes cut for each of the key elements (camera, switches, etc) and they are centered perfectly where they need to be. I haven't test long enough to be sure that the Ipad doesn't get too hot in the case, but I'm presuming this would have been featured prominently in reviews if it had been a problem.The color of the case is a pleasing blue with black appointments.  All told, it looks very nice.Cons:There aren't a lot of cons to this one.First, the clasp feels a little weak. It snaps magnetically to hold the case closed but it opens with barely a touch.  It does flip back flush against the back and is also held by a magnet to keep it from getting in the way.Second, the seams of the case are tightly sewn but in order to all some slack so you can open the case, it looks a little funky.  Nothing big but it jumped out at me right when I saw it. I probably won't notice it much in a day or two, but its there.Third, the switch on the keyboard is on top when the case is closed and I'm hoping it won't be turning itself on by mistake. My suggestion would be to put the switch on the bottom of the keyboard which is inside the case when it is closed.Last, because it is a slipcase, I'm wondering if there is ANY protection if it drops and hits a corner.  I've already lost one Ipad that way...The cons do not detract much from the overall rating for the case.  Its a nice looking, well functional, well designed case for my Ipad.  If you are looking for a case with a keyboard, this one is slim profiled and the keyboard is responsive and solid. I recommend it!","02 27, 2013",Review Belkin IPAD Case with Keyboard (YourType),1361923200,Electronics

"I picked up the Playstation 4 Camera alongside my PS4 and it was the first thing I tried out.After less than 24 hours it's clear that the camera has a lot of potential but is still missing a compelling gaming function. The Playroom set of minigames that come with the camera are made by Double Fine, and are a lot of fun but very very short. You won't get a ton of play out of them.The really nice feature is the facial auto-login and tracking to see who is holding what controller. Very quick and seamless.The sensor itself is only 720P, which is a bit of a disappointment, but its low light performance is surprisingly good. I used it with the lights off and just morning low light coming through the closed shades, and it seemed to report a much brighter room than the one I was sitting in. The image is fairly grainy, but it's definitely serviceable. Suspect the choice to go with a 720P sensor was sothey could make larger cells that absorb more light.It also has a very wide field of vision. Definitely larger than the original Kinect.Speaking of Kinect, the gesture recognition seems to be decent. You can wave at the Playroom robots and they wave back. But there isn't an app or anything that lets you see what the PS Camera is &#34;seeing&#34; as far as gesture detection so it's hard to really know. No kinect-like Skeleton overlay, at least none that I've found as yet.Haven't used the camera for Twitch yet but I suspect that is its real draw. And it's high enough resolution that you should be able to do a PIP of your face while gaming and still be relatively recognizable.Four stars for simply working well and being nice and compact. Much prefer this size for a camera, being able to tuck it under the lip of my TV stand on top of the Wii U sensor bar, than a large chunky footprint of my 360 Kinect, and eventually XB1 Kinect 2.0, both of which are just a bit too large for me aesthetically in my living room. I always put the Kinect camera away when I'm not using it because it just looks too big ... the Playstation 4 Camera is nice and unobtrusive and I can tuck its cord away to be nearly invisible. Considering motion gaming makes up about ... oh ... 0.0000003% of my Television time, making it small is a big thing to get me to leave it connected.Would update to 5 stars if there is ever an actually compelling gaming reason to own the camera, but I'm getting it more for video chatting with friends and for the promise of future voice commands. But I can understand why most people would opt to skip the camera for now ... there isn't a huge reason to get it yet.","11 15, 2013",Decent camera seeking a compelling purpose.,1384473600,VideoGames

"This is a port of a 2010 Japanese arcade game. However, Akai Katana goes far beyond just providing a straight arcade port.First, there is Origin Mode which is a straight port featuring the original 4:3 aspect ratio, but with remastered graphics for HD televisions.Next, there is Slash Mode which features new gameplay mechanics, scoring techniques, an extra stage, and has been reconfigured and rebalanced to run in 16:9 widescreen.Finally, there is Climax Mode which is a rebalanced and harder version of Origin Mode featuring the additions (extra stage, widescreen) from Slash Mode to challenge players who have mastered the other modes.The gameplay mechanics are a bit complicated to grasp, but are a lot of fun once they click. In a nutshell, it involves flying your aircraft and shooting enemies to release collectable items, summoning a powerful ninja phantom, and cashing in items for massive scoring gains. The game systems are all explained in great detail within the full-color instruction manual. Akai Katana is one of the best looking 2D games out there. Even the game menus are attractive, ensuring that no aspect of this game was left unpolished.Definitely buy this if you are a shoot-em-up fan, and give it some serious consideration even if you are not. This is a good entry point for newcomers to the genre, and a great way to add some diversity to your game collection.","06 1, 2012",A Fantastic Arcade Port,1338508800,VideoGames
"First of all, I'm a huge DBZ fan, so I decided I wanted to collect the orange bricks. I decided to go with the Orange Bricks instead of the Dragon Boxes for one main reason: The Orange Bricks contain the Bruce Faulconer American soundtrack, and they're cheaper. To be honest, I prefer the show with the Japanese music, however the American music is nostalgic for me, so I wanted these for that reason as well, and there are some episodes where I think the American music works really well.The Dragon Boxes, however, have better remastering. With those, the artists removed the dirt and scratches by HAND. With these Orange Bricks, the film was put through a machine, which ate up not only the dirt and scratches, but some detail as well. It sometimes results in blurry image quality, and when characters are powering up, some of the detail is gone from their face. This is a problem, but it's not a huge problem for me, because overall it still looks good. The colors might be a bit oversaturated, but they still look very good. Another flaw in this set is that the image is cropped 16:9 instead of 4:3 when it was originally intended to be 4:3. This results in some of the top and bottom being cut off. Again, not a huge problem for me, but for some it is.Overall, if you want to go cheaper or if you want to have the American background music, I'd go with these sets. If you want the best remastering and prefer the Japanese dub, I'd shell out some more money for the Dragon Boxes (which contain both the Japanese and English dub). But for fans like me who just want to own the series, this is still a good set to collect.","06 29, 2011","Great Season, however there are some flaws in the remastering",1309305600,MovieTV

"I didn't think that storage space was going to be an issue with the ever-increasing size of hard drives however the size of photos, music, movies, and software is also increasing in size (particularly photos where file sizes keep going up). Thus, I've been running low on hard drive space and have gotten tired of buying external drives and paying extra for the housing (I use a laptop only so 3.5&#34; internal expansion bays are not an option. This dock is a great solution for storage, you can get cheaper 3.5&#34; internal drives for archival purposes without having to pay the external hard drive premium (and you often end up getting a better hard drive for the same price this way).So, how about the performance of this drive? It's been solid on both 2.5&#34; and 3.5&#34; sata drives. It's a little hard to tell when the drive is actually mounted into the dock and the eject button doesn't really work, you just have to yank the drive out as delicately as possible. This all speaks to the poor build quality of the plastic housing which feels light and richety and doesn't seem like it would hold up to a lot of travel (fortunately that's not why you buy an hd dock).This device is USB 3.0 and I have a Dell with USB 3.0 ports however I get transfer speeds in the low 20s mb/s using 7200 rpm hard drives which is the same as the external 5400 rpm drives running USB 2.0 that I already have. It's not too surprising since there are a lot of bottlenecks running from an external hd through to the hd on my hard drive and the bottleneck may have more to do with my laptop than the nature of the USB connection, however I was hoping to see a little bit of a speed boost.Overall a good product and the price is right but don't expect anything amazing from this product.","12 30, 2012",No detectable USB 3.0 speed boost and feels a little cheap but overall it's a good product so far.,1356825600,Electronics

"Long awaited and delayed several times - this 3 CD set is finally available. All of Otis' 45s, A and B sides, on 3CDs in mono excellently remastered by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch. While the songs need absolutely no introduction-  other than to those of us who've only heard some of the tracks on Disc 3 in their stereo form - the sequencing - one 45 release after another - and the sound are a revelation. Having lived with Otis' music for 50 years next year - and having seen him in the famous ""Hit The Road Stax"" tour in London (the man was absolutely electrifying) - I had not fully appreciated how his music - and the Stax house band evolved together - as Otis moved away from his Little Richard phase to ""One and Only Man"" Steve Cropper's guitar assumed more prominence while the horns become a greater and greater ""voice"" in the music - from the coda in ""One and Only"" to their prominence in ""Mr Pitiful"", to the fully fleshed out Stax sound in ""I've been Loving you to Long"" - an evolution in which Otis was a key participant. From then on it was one soul classic after another - even when Otis covered others material. This set is not just a collection of 45s, it is the history of Southern Soul - written in the release schedules of Stax/Volt/Atco records - it is an essential addition to any collection. Who knows what Stax would have achieved if Otis had not died so tragically - or where Soul music would have gone. Otis was and remains the King of Soul.This ground breaking set from Shout/Rhino is put together with love and respect with full color reproductions of each and every 45, A and B sides, from Billy Vera's collection. While it sounds on paper no big deal, in reality it is a collector's dream. While this could this be part of a new genre in the reissue field - I unfortunately don't think that The Complete Ko-Ko Singles by Luther Ingram or The Complete Spring Singles by Joe Simon as just two examples, would recoup their investment.  This is a must  have for any Otis/Stax-Volt fan and worth more than 5 stars!Additional point  - the packaging is pretty neat - the CDs are in durable transparent sleeves that are not part of the the super sized book - they slide in and out  - took me a few moments to figure that out - so the CDs are well protected.","07 23, 2013",A must have for any Big O fan,1374537600,CDVinyl

Had we more effective law enforcement in Tucson (they have to be among the worst, probably due to budget cuts), we might have gotten the perp.  But at least I could send the images around and alert the neighborhood watch.

I bought the ELPH 330 for social situations when I am out with friends, events, and parties. Sometimes carrying a DSLR is too much to deal with.1.

The camera modes and fun and useful, even has a Program mode so you can set your flash and ISO.3. Auto mode is very smart. It analyzes your scene and determines you mode and really does have an accurate method of determining what to use. All my photos are decently exposed and the color rendering is nice.4. Used in a few low light situations, the quality of photos in low light are ""eh"" but not terrible.

"Clean the screen with a humid paper towel, them dry it. Use the provided cloth and polish the surface clean. then take a large adhesive tape and cover the entire screen, gluing the tape, removing it and then moving to the next area, until you cover the entire surface. THIS PROCEDURE WILL REMOVE ALL DUST RESPONSIBLE FOR FORMING THE AIR BUBBLES! After that, remove the tab that states it needs to be removed before applying the screen protector, then carefully position it on the touchpad screen while aligning the camera, the home button, and the edges. Let the film alone for a small period of time and watch the film while it settles on top of the screen. Large bubbles will become small...  when the settling process is completed, gently massage the bubbles towards the edges. Combine small bubbles into large ones before starting the migration. This process took 3-5 min for me. Not all bubbles will disappear, but you should stop when it seems your efforts in migrating the bubbles to the edge stop to bring results. At this time peel the other tab that states it needs to be removed AFTER the install. YOU WILL NOW BE SURPRISED FOR A 100% BUBBLE FREE protected screen.

"This was the best value for a Note II protector I could find on Amazon. I haven't experienced any downsides specific to this product other than the wider than average gap to the edge of the screen.This is just one of many ""layers"" of protection for the device. My prime reason for using this type of screen protector is that it provides tensile strength for the glass screen (like laminated auto glass). This reduces the chances of the screen cracking or shattering if the phone is dropped or something is dropped on it. Scratch protection isn't the issue it once was with today's high tech glass screens, but it never hurts.Ease of application, benefit of the 3 packApplying these beasties without bubbles is always a challenge if you don't have a clean room available. With pets in the house, that's not happening. There always seems to be a stray bit of dust that hides until actually applying the protector or picked up from the air after removing the protective layer. The first sheet often ends up being the tack sheet that gets the stray dust for a clean application of the second, so a multipack is a must. I can't remember replacing a protector, even after many years of use, but I still have a pristine sheet for later if needed.Wider than typical gap around the edge of screen (a minus for me, may be a plus for you)All screen protectors need to be a bit smaller than the screen or you have to get the alignment perfect to avoid bits extending over the edge of the screen, which makes for peeling protector syndrome. This protector, and the others I found for the the Note 2, have a larger than typical (it is about 1mm smaller all around). Since this leaves critical corners and edges have less protection, I take 1 star off for that. The screen should still be less susceptible to damage if dropped on a corner than a bare screen.Alignment during application isn't as critical as it would be with a smaller gap and less likelihood of interference with some protective covers that cover the edges of the screen could be considered positives.","02 3, 2013",Good screen protection for a fair price,1359849600,CellPhone

"See No Evil is not a remakable Horror/Slasher flick by any means and the only thing that sets this movie apart from the multitudes of this genre was WWE'S Kane. Kane's performance as a newbie actor was decent and it wasn't to challenging especially in the line department with 3 or 4 words the entire movie. His size, shaved head and eyebrow bone structure all help to add to his mensacing and domineering appearance. The real challenge for him was when he had to make facial expressions to enhance a scene and again he does a decent job.The only reason that I am giving all this info on Kane is for the WWE fans that are intrested in this movie because of his staring role if they haven't seen it yet. I myself am not what you would call an avid fan, but I do enjoy some of the WWE members and a couple that have entered into acting. So now my disclaimer is out of the way lets get back to the movie.The movie itself as I have mentioned is more or less just another slasher flick from lionsgate that had a higher budget than the typical slasher flick. The story is revenge based with the usual teen cast that is the prey for the large and demented Kane. The killers behavior comes from his mothers twisted religious upbringing and her distain for young women. The poor boy is caught with some girlie pics and he did what many boys do and got caught. ""Oh so embarrassing"" This has an odd effect on Kanes character and his relationships with women if you can call it that?The set up is a couple of cops are called to a home and as they start to investigate they hear a woman scream and then they are attacked. One cop is killed and another is wounded (hint...hint) and the bad guy is shot, but never found (hint). Fast forward a few years and the the cop is now working at a detention facility for young teen/adult offenders who are given a chance to shorten their sentences in return for cleaning a old hotel thats being restored. Now you know all you need to know about the story.The acting by this young cast was better than expected and they were able to a credibly pull off their given roles in this short on story/plot movie. The delapidated hotel location works well as the creepy backdrop for Kane's evil playground. The director did a decent job, but could have gotten more out of the cast, location and gore that would have made for a more memorable movie. It kind of seemed like the director was as burnt out on making horror flicks as I am on watching just another average cookie cutter slasher/horror flick.The two big issues in this movie for me was they never described just what Kane's character is other than the obvious? When you watch the movie you should be able to catch my meaning when you notice whats going on in his head? I don't just mean his mental state! The other obviously glaring issue is its averageness.Was this movie worth the time to watch? Yes and No. Was this a scary movie? No. Was it gory? Yes and they do a pretty realistic job of it. Is there sex and nudity? Yes, but the nude scenes only show the back half of a girl. Was there drug use? Yes Was there foul language? Yes, but not over the top.I hope this will help you decide if you want to watch this average, but good acted and gory movie.Rating 0 to 5Story = 1Acting = 3Direction = 2.4Fear Factor = 2Gore = 4.3Sex/Nudity = Yes/ Yes back side only.Cursing - Yes, but not over the top.Entertainment Value = 2.3Would I watch again?

"I've owned this external battery for 2 weeks and so far it has exceeded my expectations.  I originally purchased this as an emergency back-up for my iPhone and iPad and it has functioned exceptionally well in that capacity.  The benefit that I didn't even think about was the fact that this external battery has 2 USB ports, which seems to be compatible with several other electronic devices that I own.  One example of that is a portable hot spot that I own.  The charger for the hot spot plugs into a port on a charger with a USB cord and unfortunately the hot spot's battery only lasts about 3 hours.  With the New Trent external battery I can power up my hot spot all day.  I've found early on that if I use the New Trent external battery for a few hours in one day I need to charge it at night.  If I only use it to take my iPhone from an almost dead battery to fully charged (just over one hour to charge) then I can use it for two days without recharging.  I personally don't mind plugging my phones and batteries in every night and if you do that with the New Trent external battery I guarantee you won't ever have to worry about a dead battery on your iPhone or iPad.  The other great thing about this product is you can charge your iPhone and iPad at the same time!  That obviously takes longer to recharge the devices but you won't have to worry about running out of battery on either device.  I would highly recommend this product!Pros-Never need to worry about battery dying if you aren't near an outlet-The need to always be on the lookout for outlets to recharge devices-Can charge pretty much any device that connects to USB port-Small enough to carry in briefcase/backpack, about the size of a deck of cards (but heavier)-Display lights are very obvious to see how much power remainsCons-Need to charge every night if heavy use in one day (not an issue for me)","09 23, 2012",Great back up battery!,1348358400,CellPhone

That being said, I think I could probably say the same about most Blu-ray players.Here's what I don't like:* Some apps can't be removed and stay, annoyingly, in your list of apps, taking up prime spots I'd rather use for apps I actually want.  For example, I can't remove: Netflix, Pandora, HuluPlus, Kids, Vudu, ShopTV, Fitness, MLB.TV, etc.  I don't like the fact that I purchase a product and am then told what I can and can't do with it.

"Five POWERFUL Stars! Maxboost Dual-Port USB Car Charger packs a bigger power punch than most. The lightweight (.8 ounce) white charger unit has a soft plastic upper area which is perforated with holes around the side for easier grasping. At just under 3 inches long, it can be inserted into the cigarette lighter socket and allows more access to the center console coin tray and ash tray areas than some other dual-port car chargers. It has a low power blue LED on the top allowing the driver to see the USB port areas in darkness. The USB ports are rated at a total of 4.4 Amps, with one port rated at 2.4 Amps/12 Watts targeted for iPads and iPhones and the other port rated at 2.0 Amps/10 Watts for Android devices, but I've charged iPhones successfully off of both ports with no problems. The ports are inverted so the 'USB cable symbols' on the heads are actually facing away from each other. In testing the charger with the car engine running, a newer generation power-depleted iPhone was `up for use' in 5 minutes and an older generation power-depleted iPhone was `up for use' in 6 minutes using this USB dual charger. The ports are marked with their amperage but blend into the surrounding colors making them difficult to read: but if the LED is positioned to the left, the higher rated 2.4 Amp port is above the other port 2.0 rated port. The ports are designed to stop charging when the devices have reached full charge. Highly Recommended. Five EFFECTIVE Stars! (1- Maxboost dual-port car charger. User manual. One year warranty.

"Even though the manual says that you should not use this device while charging, it works fine for me, which is a relief since I leave it plugged in at all times and never really plan on using battery power.  I just leave it plugged into the TV.  The audio cable is very short, but it only needs to be a few inches long.  I used a piece of double-sided tape to secure it to the back of my TV, right next to the headphone output.  The main reason for purchasing it is because there is so much static and interference with analog wireless headphones designed for listening to TV wirelessly.  The sound quality is much better with Bluetooth, so I paired this with Bluetooth headphones and get great results.I was a little worried at first, because with most Bluetooth connections you need some sort of master device to set up the initial connection, such as a phone or computer to select what you want to connect to and enter the passcode.  Neither this device or the headphones I wanted to connect have a way of selecting a device or entering info.  It turns out that this transmitter does it automatically.  It searches for devices, automatically selects the closest one, and automatically tries passcodes 0000, 1111, 8888, and 1234 (which is what pretty much all Bluetooth headsets use).  This gets around the problem quite elegantly.  I simply turned on both devices and they paired right up.Some people have complained about a delay that makes it impractical for watching videos, but I've been using it to watch Star Trek for several days, and all the lips seem to sync up perfectly.  There may a slight delay if you try very hard to look for it, but it seems imperceptible to me.  I don't think you can connect multiple headsets to it at once, and I have not tried.  This would seem to be the only disadvantage of using it as a television Bluetooth transmitter.  Sometimes you want to connect multiple headsets so that multiple people can listen in.  TVs that have Bluetooth built in probably have this option, and probably produce better sound quality as well, but for me, this simple solution works perfectly.","04 5, 2013",Works perfect as a TV audio transmitter for me,1365120000,Electronics

"We live in a culture of movie remakes that require abundant violence and action, as if to say that anything less would be a failure at the box office. With this fear in mind, movie (re)makers don't mind altering a character's true attributes or an established franchise's tone and pace, as long as massive profits materialize. Man of Steel is all of the above: a brawned-up barrage of CGI with shaky camerawork thrown in for good measure. At times, I enjoyed watching this film, but other times I rolled my eyes. Hence, the mediocre review here. This movie reminds me of a Star Trek reboot (though much worse), a Star Wars prequel, Batman reboots, Spider-Man, and Dune, though none of these are bad in their own right. They're in fact very good. It's unfortunate that I conclude that this movie felt more like the aforementioned movies and miniseries' than Superman. I strongly feel that this movie is a sellout from a creative standpoint. It's not a disaster, but is annoying enough to categorize it with the saturated market of over the top action movies out there, instead of a genuine superhero tale. Furthermore, the acting is mediocre at best, which adds to the overall shaky experience. I can't recommend or not recommend this movie. 5/10","01 18, 2014","Not Super, Not Bad",1390003200,MovieTV

"The Orb Mod 1 satellite speakers have a beautiful circular design breaking the mold of speakers in a rectangular box. The Orbs measure 4.25&#34; in diameter. The 3&#34; aluminum cone driver sets in a circular metal casing and has a rounded metal front grill. The Mod 1's have high quality custom gold plated brass binding posts and come with a metal desk stand. The Orb speakers hardly take up any room which makes them ideal as main speakers when paired with a mini amp to create a very compact laptop or desktop computer audio setup or if creating a bookshelf audio system. The Mod 1 speakers very small size also makes them ideal to use as surround speakers in a larger home theater system or used as front speakers if you desire speakers to go completely unnoticed. If you are using them for either application Orb sells wall mounts for the Mod 1's.SOUND:The Mod 1's have a forward, clean sound. I'm able to crank the volume with these speakers and the clarity holds up very well. The speakers simply consist of a 3&#34; driver so don't expect any bass thumping from them. The specs state a frequency response of 80Hz-20kHz but I feel they'd be lucky to produce any frequencies below 110Hz. I have other satellite and bookshelf speakers with similar frequency response but they produce noticeably more bass. It is worth noting those speakers are significantly larger than the Orb's. Because the Mod 1's lack a tweeter I also find their highs not to be as bright as the satellite and bookshelf speakers. None of this is to dissuade a potential buyer from the Orbs but to inform them of the trade offs of getting a speaker 1/4 to 1/10 the size of normal satellite or bookshelf speakers. The sound the Mod 1's are able to create according to their size is nothing short of impressive and makes them very attractive.SUBWOOFER:If using the Mod 1's as main speakers to achieve the best sound it's advantageous to pair them with a subwoofer. Orb makes the subMini which is designed to go with the Mod 1 speakers. Other subwoofers will work as well so long as they have a high frequency crossover. I have the subMini and it works perfectly with the Mod 1 speakers. The crossover is set at 160Hz. With a subwoofer, the 2.1 Orb audio system sounds incredible. The sound is spacious and the bass is tight. Considering the subMini and pair of Mod 1 speakers combined take up about as much space as one of my large Boston bookshelf speakers the sound the Orbs are able to create together is awesome.SUMMARY:The Orb Mod 1 speakers are made in the USA and Orb is known for their great customer service. The Mod 1's are beautifully designed speakers that can be used for many different applications. Their tiny size, high quality durable build, and sound quality make them an excellent choice as satellite speakers in a larger home theater system. You could even use several Mod 1's and a subwoofer to create a full home theater system that no one will know is even there. The Mod 1's can also be use to create a compact computer audio system or bookshelf system. Just be realistic about their sound if you are used to much larger bookshelf or floorstanding speakers. Paired with a subwoofer any reservations about their very limited bass output completely goes away. I am currently using the Orbs along with the subMini as a 2.1 desktop computer audio system and couldn't be happier.Note: A product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.","03 17, 2014",Beautifully Designed Speakers That Can Serve Multiple Purposes,1395014400,Electronics

"It's a nice looking rig and it worked OK with a folding HT antenna affixed to the top.  I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it.  I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roof-mount antenna.  Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles (verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end).As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio's jack, the radio's jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack.  This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn't screw on more than 1/2 turn.

"I bought two of these fans; Previously I had one before this order but managed to break it at no fault to the unite (user error). But It took a lot to break, it is the best made fan I have ever known. Mine fell off my desk as I was running it and it hit EVERYTHING on the way down (I cried as it turned into shrapnel). I fell in love with the fan because first and foremost it moved crap tons of air without any noise from the motor itself, all that could be heard was the sound of the air it pushed. I have a Corsair H80 liquid cooler, the fans; if anyone owns one of these coolers knows that the two fans that it comes with move at 2500 rpm and move a ridiculous amount of air in a straight line as do the Exalibur's. But what surprised me the most is that with the Exalibur's you get the same if not a little better pressure/air movement without the ""Delta fan noise"" you get with the Corsair fans. Does that win you over??? if not the design  most certainly will, I love it. Honey comb frame to which actually has use beyond looking cool. Air is drawn into these holes which is a benefit if you want a fan go into a place that has no breathing room from the intake side. See where I'm coming from yet???Pros: Everything?? Fine, I'll be a little more descriptive geez lol.Black frame/black cable sleeves if it matters to you.2000 rpm with surprisingly low noise production.Enough air pressure to blow itself over with ease?? never really known a fan to do that, and trust me this fan isn't a feather weight. Weighs about the same as any other fan does.Cons: Psssh, moving on.Other thoughts: The frame of this thing really is quite genius, the arms that hold the impeller to the frame are curved and blade like to direct air instead of impede it. Why this isn't a standard yet The world may never know.All in all: BUY IT!!!! It does what a fan does and it does it very well, you wont regret buying it.

"Linkin Park's last couple of albums have been somewhat `scattered.'  Sure 2007'sMinutes to Midnighthad solid cuts in ""Given Up""  and ""Shadow of the Day""  while 2010'sA Thousand Sunssimilarly had ""The Catalyst.""  Despite the bright spots and the aid of Rick Rubin, the albums both had plenty of flaws.  Apparently, `third time'  may really be `charm' on 2012'sLIVING THINGS, which is easily the best of this recent trio of Linkin Park albums.  Rick Rubin returns as producer, and for whatever reason, Living Things feels more cohesive than previous releases.  It's not perfect, but at just under thirty-seven minutes, there truly is little to complain about given the tightness and brevity.""Lost in the Echo"" opens the effort capably with synth and pummeling drum programming; the sound is epic here.  Shinoda takes the reigns by rapping verses with Bennington anchoring the refrain: ""And these promises broken/deep, feeble/each word gets lost in the echo/so one last lie I can see through/this time I finally let you/Go, go, go..."" The sound is appealing, Shinoda's rhymes strong, making ""Lost in the Echo"" a superb opener.  ""In My Remains"" cedes no momentum, opening with typical Linkin Park synths and dusty, pounding drums.  The driving sound is superb once guitars enter in at full fruition.  This go-round Chester Bennington takes the lead, as capably as he did years ago.  The bridge is a selling point here, particularly the lyrics ""Like an army, falling, one by one."" At just over three minutes in duration, this is a well packaged cut.""Burn It Down,"" the strong first single, finds Linkin Park honing in on their signature sound. Bennington's lead vocals are clear, with superb vocal production.  The refrain is catchy and filled with angst, even if Bennington `tames the beast': ""We're building it up/to break it back down/we're building it up/to burn it down, we can't wait to burn it to the ground..."" Shinoda raps following the second refrain/verse while Bennington incorporates a short bridge proceeding Shinoda. ""Burn it Down"" marks three solid cuts for Linkin Park, something that may not be necessarily pertinent to its previous two albums.""Lies Greed Misery"" is less successful than the `big three,' but certainly ambitious if less accessible.  The production work is intense, accompanying Shinoda's rapping.  More manic than the openers, this cut is a bit harder to decipher.  Where listeners have been waiting for Bennington's angst-driven vocals, they come full-fledged here.  Wouldn't be a Linkin Park album if Bennington didn't scream right? ""I'll Be Gone"" finds Bennington singing more tamely and patterns itself similar to the album's initial cuts.  It doesn't possess the same flare per say, but most will find it more `traditional' than ""Lies Greed Misery.""""Castle of Grass"" takes :36 to build up, but the results are enjoyable during the `percolation' period. The verse is nothing too crazy with some sense of the static, though not in a boring sense.  The initial refrain begins restrained before the dynamics increase.  Because there is a sense of restraint, it actually makes the listener tune in more and proves ultimately rewarding. Yeah, it lacks the `overt' sound fans have come to know the band for, but ""Castles of Grass"" is something special if you give it a chance.  ""Victimized,"" one of those ever popular interludes, opens with mysterious synthetic effects.  Predictably (knowing Linkin Park's formula respectfully), hard drums and wailing guitars enter in.  Once the vocal enter, they are drenched in effects before Bennington screams histrionically ""Victimized! Victimized!"" Shinoda begins to rap against the angular production, leaving the listener to describe this cut as puzzling, interesting, and well manic.""Roads Untravelled"" finds the band exercise time to setup and establish the cut.  The harmonic progression is a highlight here, as is the use of organ.  Overall, the sound is alluring and ""Roads Untravelled"" yields some sound musical moments.  ""Roads"" may not top ""Burn It Down"" necessarily, but it is one of the standouts.The remainder of the album sort of descends into that `murky' hole that sometimes affects the entirety of Linkin Parks albums (this was a problem with their previous two albums).  Here, the cuts aren't so bad and there have been more than enough highlights to anchor this release.  ""Skin to Bone"" features captivating production work, notably a looping synth, but feels a bit underdeveloped perhaps.  ""Until It Breaks"" falls into the boat of ""Lies Greed Misery"" in the sense that it is a bit `all of the place.' Shinoda's raps are masked in vocal effects with incredibly busy and loud supporting production.  Bennington, predictably, comes in an contrasts the heaviness surrounding Shinoda. Overall, the cut is ambitious, though a bit `heady' and could stand for more songwriting `shaping' and `cues' to make it more polished.""Tinfoil,"" clocking in at just over 1:00 segues from ""Until It Breaks"" and gives the listeners an instrumental interlude.  The soundscape is very nice.  ""Powerless,"" the solid  closer, segues from ""Tinfoil."" It's not as good as the openers, but is in the league of ""Roads Untravelled.""LIVING THINGSis the first Linkin Park album in recent times as a reviewer where there are more positives than negatives.  The balance is better established here between experimentation, angst, and solid songwriting.  The production remains top-notch only becoming overwrought occasionally.  At under forty minutes, this formula and album works much better for the band.  Solid affair.","07 4, 2012",Their Best Release Within Their Most Recent Trio of Albums,1341360000,CDVinyl

"""L'Elisir d'Amore"" is a much-loved favourite of mine, and it was a true joy to watch this outstanding live production from the Vienna State Opera, which surpassed my high expectations.Rolando Villaz&oacute;n and Anna Netrebko are ideally matched and perfectly suited to the roles of Nemorino and Adina.  Vocally they shine, dramatically they sparkle, and their shared sense of fun is very evident.  The stage action is anything but static, with plenty of expended energy in response to a sparkling tempo from the orchestra.Nemorino is one of my favourite opera characters.  To dismiss him as ""the village idiot"" does him a great injustice.  He may be uneducated, but he is loyal and instinctively wise, and one has only to listen to his first duet with Adina (""Una Parola, Adina"") to know that he has the soul of a poet.  From the moment Rolando Villaz&oacute;n walks on stage with the delicious ""Quanto E Bella"", he is in his element, vocally and dramatically.  He employs just enough comedy and pathos without overdoing it, and he takes me all the way from laughter to tears and back again.  After a touchingly beautiful ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"", the Viennese audience demands (and receives) a moving encore.Anna Netrebko's Adina is playful and capricious, but right from the start she allows little glimpses of a deeper side, which finally emerges as she responds to the voice of her heart and the irresistible Nemorino.  Vocally she is brilliant, and her on-stage chemistry with Mr Villaz&oacute;n is electric.Another highlight is Leo Nucci's Belcore - a real comic gem.  For me, this opera works best when Belcore is played as a caricature, as he is here - the swaggering, self-confident sergeant - and the perfect contrast to Nemorino.  Likewise, Ildebrando d'Arcangelo's younger, smooth talking salesman seems just right for Dr Dulcamara in this setting.  He too, makes good use of his comic talents.  Not to be overlooked is the irrepressible Inna Los, revelling in the cameo role of Giannetta.My only negative comment concerns the sound quality on the DVD - it is not as clear and sharp as it could be, and I found I had to tweak my audio settings and graphic equaliser quite a bit to get it right.  However, that is a minor technical flaw, and no reflection on the performance itself.If laughter is the best medicine, then my advice is ... do yourself a favour, and purchase this efficacious and sweet-tasting dose of ""The Elixir of Love""!","10 27, 2011",The Best Medicine!,1319673600,CDVinyl

I normally use a separate remote to watch movies, etc... but wanted a wireless keyboard with good range that did not need direct line of site, so I could sit on the couch and edit names or transfer files, etc...Do check the dimensions though, I knew this would be just a little smaller than a full size keyboard, and it is. My wife was surprised and thought it would almost be remote or a larger remote size, and that it is not.I sit about 12 feet away (put on my glasses) and then can do everything I want. It has all of the controls I found important, like arrow keys (needed for Media PC Player,) Media Keys, and can use the trackball instead of a mouse. It's perfect. It has a bulky USB receiver with a sync button on it, for first time sync, but since it works from the back of the Media PC it doesn't have to make my Media PC look bad. Instead my Media PC just looks like a AV Receiver (Antec Fusion Case) and this usb receiver is hid on the back.

"Many Casual Music Fans of Oxford, Ohio's Lemon Pipers  will only remember  one of this Band's Songs and that would be ""Green Tamborine""  but in those days I was more than just a Casual Lemon Pipers Fan. Yes ""Green Tamborine"" was this Band's Most Famous Song and it was/is A 60's Classic & in December 1967 it was also The Buddah Label's First US #1 Hit Song (it was also a #7 UK Hit Song) but The Band actually had at least Three other Songs that saw  a considerable amount of Radio Airplay and they were ""Turn Around And Take A Look"" which made it to #132 on The US Charts in October 1967, ""Rice Is Nice"" which made it to #46 on The US Charts in March 1968 (and it also reached as high as #41 in The UK) and ""Jelly Jungle (Of Orange Marmalade)"" which made it to #51 on The US Charts in May 1968 & All Four are on This Disc. I'm Sure I have also heard ""Blueberry Blue"" on The Radio Airwaves too because it sounded Very familiar when I first heard it on This Disc. Some of these other Tunes have grown on me too. ""Everything Is You"" is a Very Good Song.Some Modern Day Music Fans would call The Lemon Pipers Music Weird & Strange but I called The Lemon Pipers Music Unique & Different & alot of today's Music Weird & Strange!.....Is this Music Bubblegum Music?.....Sorta:  but The Pipers Music also had a slight touch of Pop, Psychedelia & even Acid-Rock in it. Hey!.....It was The Swinging 60's & The Beatles were still together & ""Hey Jude"" Plus Magical Mystery Tour's ""All You Need Is Love"" & Hello Goodbye"" were also Riding High on The Charts then Plus The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Etc Etc Etc were also getting in on The Flower Power Scene!.....The Lemon Pipers Fit Right In during That Era and it was Great!!Final Thoughts: For being Songs from 1967 & 1968: This 2006 BMG CD has Outstanding Sound Quality & it comes in a Standard Plastic Jewel  Case & The Liner Notes consist of a Brief Two Page Biography of The Band & also Song Titles. The Lemon Pipers weren't anything like The 1910 Fruitgum Co or The Ohio Express but when you look at The Song Lineup on A Various Artists Bubblegum Compilation: you will usually see ""Green Tamborine"" And Sometimes ""Rice Is Nice"" on that Compilation & To Tell You The Truth.....I like ""Jelly Jungle (Of Orange Marmalade)"" just as much as ""Green Tamborine"" & I like it Much better than ""Rice Is Nice"" but it don't seem to be as easy to find & that's one of the reasons why this CD is well worth owning!

"Myths & Legends of King Arthur & the Knights of the Round Table is not only a long album title to actually type out (so I'll be shortening it for now on)... it's also an awesome experience.Going into this right after Journey to the Center of the Earth, well, there's probably not *that* big of a difference between the two albums.  The biggest difference I suppose is that this album places more emphasis on vocal melodies, and especially pop vocal melodies that seem to indicate a desire to attempt commercial success.  The production techniques sound almost exactly like the Alan Parsons Project (which isn't a BAD thing of course, the APP are quite amazing in their own way as well).The intricate arrangements and the pop-like vocal melodies make me think a comparison to classic Renaissance is totally fine.  I wouldn't be surprised if the two artists used to tour together since they both had popular success around the same point in the mid 70's.  A song by the name of ""Sir Galahad"" is actually a perfect Argent imitation.  You know, the band that did ""Hold Your Head Up"" and sooooo much more (*hint hint* check out their Encore live album!  It's awesome!).The highlight is probably ""Merlin the Magician"".  The song title alone takes me back to my more innocent days and to my favorite animated childrens film the Sword in the Stone (I used to be OBSESSED with that movie to the point I'd watch it every single day... ah, the memories of being 7 years old again) however that's not to say this song is childish in any way.  No way!!Any child that admires a song like this surely has to be at the top of his class anyway because it's all about really beautiful arrangements.  There's one part about this 8-minute display of instrumental chops... actually 3 parts, that stands out to me the most.  It's whenever that GORGEOUS piano melody comes back after a more chaotic portion.  Ahhh, I love that part.  So soothing and gentle.  The way Wakeman continues to bring it back in a way that feels totally natural is true talent.""The Last Battle"" is all about displaying a really bombastic vocal melody while the other arrangements take a back seat.  I enjoy it however at first my impression was that Wakeman could have written a better melody.  You might have the same initial impression as me, be warned.  At over 9 minutes, this song quite honestly SHOULD be the highlight, but because so much of it centers around those vocals (and a pretty awesome synth jam too!) it's not the best song for me, I'm afraid.  Still, it grew on me after 4 listens, and perhaps it still is.Other moments such as ""Arthur"" is another vocal melody-driven song with piano and other instruments not really coming into the forefront like they do on most of the album, and my oh my does THAT vocal melody sound exactly like classic Kansas or what?  It's a good one too.  ""Guinevere"" is a soulful ballad of sorts... sort of a surprising move, I'd have to believe.  Wasn't expecting it at all.  Good enough melody but indicative of the mid 70's when the music scene was being flooded with this type of music.Oh, there's also some familiar chanting that comes and goes as the album rolls along, usually featured in the beginning and end of each track.  I'm not too crazy about this idea because the notes feel undeveloped and repetitive, but, on a positive note, it *does* make the music more majestic.Overall, slightly worse than the previous two Rick Wakeman albums, but not by much hence the 5-star rating I believe it deserves.","11 15, 2011",awesome vocal melodies,1321315200,CDVinyl

So she packs up the kids she is babysitting and off to the city they go.

"The stereo mix and mastering of all these tracks are fantastic! This is one of the better remastered CD's out there if you're like me, and suddenly get the urge to own about ten best of packages of artists from the British Invasion.  But, when this collection came out, it was a very expensive import.  I think the store I saw selling it from a locked glass case wanted about 65 dollars for it.  I'm sure it would have been worth it, but I was hoping maybe Rhino Records would get around to releasing an American CD of the Best of The Dave Clark Five.  Well, that never happened.  But, a few years later, a friend of mine got this collection from a store in Singapore, and brought it home here.  So, I just copied his collection and have had the two CDR'S of this collection for nearly 15 years now.Anyway, if you're like me, you can't just have one CD of an artist from the British Invasion.

"The Good: Cute Pikmin with addictive and fast paced gameplay, great graphics, Battle Mode is a blastThe Bad: Some ugly textures, no online multiplayer, micromanaging can get tedious, some major AI issues, day limit is frustratingPikmin is one of Nintendo's lesser known franchises. While the first two were fairly successful on the GameCube they didn't reach sales numbers that match Mario or Zelda. Pikmin 3 was a great start for the Wii U, especially with a system with such few games so it can garner the attention it needs. The game is cute, whimsical, and easy to play, but has a lot of micromanagement that can frustrate players.Like most Nintendo franchises, this game isn't about the story. You play as three different space men who are venturing into the solar system to find food and sustenance for their home planet. This is your main goal for the game. Each day you need to find fruit to bring back to your ship which then turns into juice. Depending on how many people are in your party on that day one juice will be consumed per person. This is where things get frustrating. When you're on the ground you go around collecting tokens which are used in the Pikmin Onions to create Pikmin. The Pikmin must carry these to the Onion and some tokens require a certain amount of Pikmin. If you alot more than the required amount the token will get carried faster. You can also bring enemy carcasses to the Onion to convert to Pikmin as well which is a neat idea. Of course you will lose Pikmin if they get caught up in water (except blue Pikmin) or killed by enemies. That's not even the frustrating part. You get about 10 minutes for the entire day to explore the area, gather Pikmin, and find fruit. Two days would go by where I get caught up on a boss, need to gather more Pikmin because I'm low, or just figure out where the fruit is.This sounds frustrating because it really is. I wish the day cycle wasn't here, it makes thing annoying. I wound up losing 100 Pikmin because they were carrying a boss carcass and fruit back to the ship and I missed getting them in the safe zone by 1 second. So I spent 2 days gathering more Pikmin and another 1 day to find a fruit. In the mean time I consumed 3 juices which left me with one. If I hadn't found a fruit on that third day I would have had a game over. Super frustrating and that's honestly not much fun.Other than this major frustration the game is super enjoyable. The game is paced really well and I felt I was blazing through areas at a brisk pace. The game keeps you on your toes with the inventive enemy designs and bosses. The variety of Pikmin is nice since they are based on elements. Rock Pikmin can smash through crystal and glass and do massive damage to enemies. Yellow Pikmin can electrocute, Red Pikmin are your base Pikmin and are resistant to fire and are great fighters. Blue Pikmin can swim but aren't good fighters. You can swap around these Pikmin and order them around with the right analog stick. I just found that micromanaging them got annoying because they can get lost and stuck in places if you leave them behind so I lost many Pikmin from that, some times I just down right lost them somewhere and had to leave them behind.The Battle Mode is really fun. Bingo Battle puts two players against each other in an effort to gather four cards in a row. You have to collect fruit, defeat enemies, and various other objectives. There's no online multiplayer which is a crying shame, but two players on the couch is better than nothing. This mode can be really addictive and the Mission Mode will keep you coming back after the story mode is complete.The game actually is one of the best looking Wii U games out there. It really shows the power of the Wii U with depth of field, high resolution textures, and some great lighting effects. There are some ugly textures like the dirt. It looks like Wii textures, maybe this was a rush job from Nintendo, I don't know. The previous complaint about the micromanaging and the day limit is too short. No online multiplayer is a bummer, but overall this is a really nice package and any Wii U owner should check this game out.","04 9, 2014",One of the best looking games on Wii U,1397001600,VideoGames

"Knowing the premise of the film even before seeing it, I expected a sharp satire & disemboweling of American consumerism -- and I got it. What I didn't expect was the compassion I felt for the victims of that mentality, here embodied by Gary Cole & Glenne Headly. The toll exacted by their need to keep up with the Joneses is at first comic & pathetic, but ultimately heartbreaking. And sadly, it's really not over the top at all; countless Americans suffer a similar fate to some degree, being so obsessed with looking ""successful"" that they fail as human beings & ultimately lose themselves in the end.As for the Joneses themselves? David Duchovny is very good as the slick former car salesman who retains a withered root of conscience, one that begins to blossom anew as he sees what's happening to his neighbors (e.g., victims). Demi Moore has the requisite glossy hardness to convince us that to her, nothing is personal, it's all just business. All that ever really matters is being a ""winner"" & getting ahead. And their model-perfect teen ""children"" are marvels at taking advantage of their peers, whose desperation to fit in & be cool makes them very easy prey indeed.I've tried not to give away too much of the plot, so let me just say that while the redemption of one character is quite believable, I'm not so sure about the other one. Perhaps there was studio pressure to have some sort of a happy ending; but in this case, a somewhat bleaker ending would have been more appropriate. Some people choose to put themselves beyond redemption, and I expected more of that by the end.Still, how many contemporary films even begin to delve into the emptiness of American consumerism & materialism, rather than encouraging & glorifying it? For that alone, and for the strength of most of the film, I heartily recommend this film to anyone who questions the shallow values of what passes for our culture today. What's frightening is just how plausible the presented scenario really is ... or could it be happening already?

"""The Naked City"" represented a change in crime films away from the theatrical guns and molls of the 30s (""Public Enemy"", ""Little Caesar"", ""Scarface"") and the film noir of the 40s (""Maltese Falcon"", ""Double Indemnity"") to a more realistic POV. Of course, guns and molls and film noir continued, but slowly the more realistic crime drama emerged (""On the Waterfront"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""The Phenix City Story""), and ""Naked City"" became a popular TV series (1958-63).This new wave of crime drama had several features. They were almost always shot on location (usually New York), in black and white, often based on true events, and often utilized voice over. Although violence and gun fire were included, they were not the main focus. This subgenre of film was easily transferred to the small screen and gave birth to many of the early crime dramas on TV (""Martin Kane, Private Eye"", ""Public Defender"", ""Justice"").So if ""The Naked City"" has some historical importance as one of the first of a successful subgenre, how well does it stand the test of time? Unfortunately not too well. Barry Fitzgerald was a wonderful actor, but he is adrift at sea as the Lieutenant in charge, and his thick Irish accent is difficult to understand. His fellow actors (Howard Duff as a suspect, Don Taylor as a detective, Walter Burke as a small time thief) appear uncomfortable in their roles, perhaps because this was one of the first films of its type.FWIW - if you look closely you'll see all kinds of actors in small parts in this film who went on to great careers - Look for Nehemiah Persoff, Paul Ford, Bruce Gordon, James Gregory, John Marley, David Opatposhu, and John Randolph among others.What does stand the test of time is the great black and white photography of William Daniels (1901-70). Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim. Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won for this film.Jules Dassin (1911-2008) directs. Dassin did a number of film noir movies (""Thieves Highway"", ""Night and the City"") before getting in trouble during the HUAC witch hunt and left for Europe where he made ""Rififi"" (1955), one of the earliest heist movies. In 1961 he was nominated for an Oscar as director and writer for ""Never on Sunday"".Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (""A Double Life"", ""Spellbound"", ""Ben Hur""). He was particularly adept in the film noir genre (""Double Indemnity"", ""Brute Force"", ""The Killers"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"") and his work in this film is excellent, showing that less is more.FWIW - Dassin, Daniels, and Rozsa worked together on ""Brute Force"" (1947) just before doing this film.In 1948, Bogart and Huston teamed up to make the #4 (""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"")and #12 (""Key Largo"")top grossing films of the year and went on to win two Oscars (Director, Supporting Actor). Other top 10 grossing films were ""The Red Shoes"", ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Red River"", ""Easter Parade"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""The Snake Pit"" and ""Joan of Arc"".""Naked City"" won an Oscar for Daniels and for Paul Weatherwax (Editing) and was nominated for Best Writing.If you're particularly interested in film history, this film will appeal to you because it was such an innovative film. And the photography and music are still first rate, but the acting and the script leave a lot to be desired by modern standards.Bottom line - great historical importance but doesn't stand the test of time.","10 4, 2011","Of Historical Interest, But Doesn't Stand the Test of Time",1317686400,MovieTV

"I am lucky to have originally watched my first showing of ""Aviator"" back in 2005 through a movie theater in San Diego California (I use to live in California when I was still in the military). Aviator is a captivating movie that highlights Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Howard Hughes. The film captures Howard Hughes rise in wealth and fame during his lifetime through his work in aviation and the Hollywood film industry.  There are multiple popular celebrities that featured in this film such as: Cate Blanchett, John Reilly,Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Gwen Stefani, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, and Brent Spiner. I admit that I purchased this dvd due to being a fan of DiCaprio's acting and noticed the great bonuses which include:Disc One:Feature commentary by director Martin Scorcese, Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and Producer Michael Mann, an image of Leonardo DiCaprio pictured with Kate BeckinsaleDisc Two (many multiple features such as):Deleted Scene: Howard tells Ava about the car accident.

"Saving Mr. Banks is the kind of film that Hollywood ought to love. It's about how one of the most beloved movies in movie history got made. And it's the first time Walt Disney has ever been portrayed in a movie, so that's saying a lot. And, just to put all of this perspective, when Disney first heard that the movie was being made, they're first reaction was to buy it and squash it. See, there's a reason Walt has never been portrayed onscreen before. However, after looking at it, they decided not only not to do that but to produce it! It's that kind of movie.And it's good. I mean, it's really good. I know it is because my wife cried through about the last third of it. I will be extremely surprised if it doesn't get the best picture Oscar this year. Overall, from what we've seen so far, I think it's most well rounded show out there. And it leaves you feeling good after having had a good cry.Not to get into what the movie is about, but it's about how Walt Disney convinced P. L. Travers to give him the rights to make Mary Poppins, something it took him 20 years to do. Along with that story, you see the story of the defining moment of Travers' childhood, which shows why Poppins was so important to her. From what I've seen from fact-checking, the movie is fairly accurate, which is another plus. A big one, actually. They did have hours and hours of audio recordings from sessions with Travers and some of the people working on the movie (because she insisted that everything be recorded), so they wouldn't have had a good excuse for it not being accurate.So, first, let's talk Tom Hanks. Oh, man, Tom Hanks was... incredible. There were moments, especially when they showed him watching himself on the old black and white TV show Walt introduced, where he was just like Disney. And, from everything I've read, Hanks did capture Walt to an amazing extent. I do know that the folks at Disney Studios shaved Hanks' mustache to the exact dimensions that Walt wore his. His only being called a supporting actor for this role, but I think it's a safe bet that he will at least get a nomination for it. I will not at all be surprised if he wins. Actually, I hope he does. [I haven't seen Captain Phillips, yet, but he's also being talked about for a best actor nomination for that one.]Then, we have to talk Emma Thompson, and she may just deserve best actress for her performance. That's a tough call for me, though, because Sandra Bullock carried an entire movie virtually by herself, and that's an impressive feat. However, I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off Travers the way Thompson did. It was a great performance, and she and Hanks were perfect together.Paul Giamatti was lovable as Ralph, the chauffeur. This role probably wasn't especially difficult for Giamatti, but he was perfect in it. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak were awesome as Richard and Robert Sherman. Not the parts called for too much, but it was great to see them in the movie. They were good, too. Especially this one part with Novak, but I don't want to spoil it, so you'll just have to see it; then, I'll tell you which one.Which brings us to Colin Farrell. Farrell is one of those underrated actors who is almost always excellent despite the horrible movies he's in. I mean, Alexander wasn't really his fault, and how can you blame him for not turning down Total Recall? At any rate, he's wonderful and wonderfully tragic as Travers Goff. He was my favorite part of the movie. I mentioned that my wife cried, but there were some scenes of Goff with his daughter where I almost cried. That's kind of saying a lot for me.I loved this movie. Of the possible best picture nominees, if you have to pick just one, this is the one I would recommend. Sure, Gravity is visually amazing, but this movie has heart that Gravity just doesn't have, no matter how you feel about Walt Disney. And let me make this clear, the movie is not about Walt Disney; the script was written (and not changed) before Disney (the Company) had a hand in it; the movie is about Travers and how she was ultimately convinced to allow Walt to make Mary Poppins into a movie. It's definitely worth seeing.","01 9, 2014",the movie Disney didn't squash,1389225600,MovieTV

"The Gaslight Anthem's gravel-voiced statesman Brian Fallon has always had an astounding ability to sing the most cryptic, soul-piercing lyrics with such ease, as if he were singing the Archies' 'Sugar Sugar.' This side project, with friend and guitarist Ian Perkins, further establishes Fallon as one of my generation's greatest songwriters and vocalists. If ""Elsie"" had been released as the Gaslight Anthem's fourth album rather than a solo effort by Fallon, it would have been the band's third masterpiece in a row.It's not surprising that ""Elsie"" sounds a lot like the Gaslight Anthem, but its horizons expand in subtle ways. Fallon's words are, as always, deep and hauntingly poetic, whether it's the should-have-been-hit-singles 'Behold the Hurricane,' 'I Witnessed a Crime,' and 'Ladykiller,' or the slower, more intricately wound laments like 'Cherry Blossoms' and the painful but ferocious 'Blood Loss.'""Elsie"" is, in my opinion, the best album released in 2011. Whether it was Adele's inane moaning that sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, or Dwight Yoakum's comeback ""Bald Spot Or Not"" album that kept this album from the Billboard 200 (though it did peak on the Independent Albums chart at #6), Fallon and Perkins crafted a flawless album. Look for the Gaslight Anthem's next release in mid-July - Fallon will have a tough act to follow.","05 9, 2012","Overlooked Candidate For Album of the Year, 2011",1336521600,CDVinyl

"A must see in the theaters if you are a fan of this franchise. Unless you have good surround sound the scares won't be as good at home, but turned up loud can give a nice scare. I liked how they tied in the first movie with this one to give us more background on everything. My wife always comments that they seem to always shoot inside really nice homes. Definitely gives you that false sense of security and everything being fine. The scares were definitely good in this one and some parts I feel were really freaky giving you some goosebumps. Usually most sequels will go way over the top and this one stayed true to what made the first one successful. Blu ray wasn't necessary for this movie, DVD quality was perfectly fine. Can't say there were any special features worth mentioning.

"I've haven't bought a CD player in 20 yrs. So I went out and I read everything I possibly could on each kind, transport, slot, bad chips,expensive day chips,etc,etc,etc,,I was going to order a Music Hall which is $500,but Samtech electronic catalog wasn't component enough to know they had a 500 CD order they couldn't get in the mail.Long story short. I purchased the Onkyo 7030 CD player. It's okay .. It's not the best sound I've heard from a CD player,but it's not that bad also.. I've been letting it run continuously for 3 days to wear in the capacitor, and DAC??? I haven't heard much diff??? I do like the build and the size,weight of the Onkyo.Hey, u get what u pay for, right??? So if it really wanting a dedicated CD playey? Well u might want to go to a higher end player,but for the money, it good to go with this Onkyo CD player..Good luck........Well it's been 4 days now since I've received the 7030. I've only tried, yes tried to listen at diff intervals in hopes that the capacitor and processors work in and warm up. And let me tell u that u must!!! Must break this player in for at least 50 hrs before even listening to it. If not the sound is just totally inherent of any type of real quality sound output !! Trust me on this one? ?I've let it run on repeat straight through since I've gotten it and wAd going to pack it up and send it back, and order an Emotiva, or Cambridge Audio,Azure. I put in a disk that I know well with a piece of bright piano, and good lows.. I wasn't expecting what came out!!! It was like night and day!!!!! I'm real picky down to cable's!! I hate it at times,well most times. But this one time I'm sure of the some of the most beautiful, so precise sound. I'm baffled, really!!! I had heard to do this with any new product, but to this degree? ? At this price point from Amazon,and not some British company with some type organic material from the planet of quasars that makes the CD player not only sound that great but doesn't sound anything near this player!!As I said. I looked and read for months about a new CD player,and honestly as stupid but as common as it may b? Yes I fell into the sstereotypes that if it's cheap it's sounds cheap??? This isn't the case here which I do agree with this analogy.I had reservations about Onkyo because I remember them back in the 80-90. And they were high price gear that u had to find special, and then one day I saw an Onkyo component in Sam's wholesale. I was turned off. What was I to think? Goes from high end shops to Sams? Well I'm sorry for being so naive Onkyo!!I'm so glad that Samtech Elec online was to slow in sending my order and thank God.Very Happy, JAmes C","07 11, 2014",Pure hifi heaven!!!,1405036800,Electronics

Merlin has been giving him advice to Corky on how to capture an audience, but that night no one seemed to care about him being on stage doing a card trick. Everyone was involved with their own dates. It made him angry on stage.The next year, a network talent representative, Todson (David Ogden Stiers), sits with Corky's agent, Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith), to watch Corky's new act.

"The ""Cedar Rapids"" storyline was good enough to maintain interest,provided one ignored over-the-top performances and a tendency to drifttowards being a dreaded Hollywood ""LAFF RIOT"".Tim Lippe (played by Ed Helms) seemed miscast and was one of the worstoffenders. With Sigourney Weaver as a prime example in ""Snow Cake,""many actors see being drunk, mad or under the influence of drugs as anexcuse to depict all three types of behaviour, at the same time, andmore of their own invention thrown in - without restraint. In short,""anything goes"".In this vein, Tim Lippe was able to wheel inpredicably unrestrained impressions of being over-pious,tongue-tied, retarded, autistic, childlike, extraverted, introverted,chaste and sex-crazed as the whim took him.I don't actually agree with criticisms elswhere that the  script was ""lazy,"" (apart from its over-use of foul language)but I'd certainly criticise the movie's various sub-plots for being extremely lazy.The themes of over ""religious"" people being hypocrites, prostituteshaving hearts of gold, paragons of virtue being led astray andsupposedly comic characters getting ""high"" are totally ""Lazy"" and havebeen absolutely done to death in low-grade comedy.All this is a pity because, with a little more sophistication, themovie is mildly memorable and had potential to be much better.","10 25, 2012","Not quite another dreaded Hollywood ""LAFF RIOT""",1351123200,MovieTV

"First, I bought from electronics-expo add a dot com to that.  They are or were an amazon seller but I spoke to a rep of theirs and they matched amazons historic low on these.  Steal considering the prices everyone is selling them at now.I bought these as gaming headphones for use with the PC.  My biggest concern that I couldn't find an answer to was sound bleed with the open design.  Playing BF3 at ""normal"" volumes and you hear minimal if anything when sitting 4 feet away.  Unless they are listening for it they won't notice and/or hear it.  I quantify ""normal"" as louder than I'd ever play with a normal speaker setup.  I live in a condo renovated from apartments so I have close neighbors.  I also have wife and kid so volume is an issue when it comes to gaming. Can tear it up and she doesn't bat an eye while sitting 4 feet from me doing facebook or whatever.  The boy played dinosaur train games on the same 4' away pc for close to an hour before he noticed what I was doing.  He's not supposed to see the blatant violence.  If sound bleed is a concern I say don't worry about it at all.General review of the headphones (gaming with BF3 only since that's what mine are for):Comfort- Don't notice them at all over long periods (4hr+).  My ears do get warm but I like things to be sub 68 degrees F at all times.  They aren't hot or sweaty or even noticeable until I take them off.  I forget I'm wearing them most of the time.Bass- this is my first venture into decent headphones so I'm not a good judge.  I don't hear the ridiculously low tones that I would with the sub in the living room (tuned to 16hz) nor does it shake my body but these have plenty of bass to get a pretty good effect from the battlefield.  When a grenade or tank or any explosion goes off next to you, you hear a nice low tone.  When tanks rumble by you know they are rumbling by.  Bass light was my second biggest concern with these, or any open headphone.  Bass light sounds like a horrible mind splitting experience but they hold their own and short of a full sized sub, I don't guess you'll do any better without compromising overall sound.  Going to guess they hold their own with any HTIB sub but they aren't going to shake you.Positional audio- BF3 is horrible for positional audio.  Way too much going on at any given time.  I'm using an asus xonar DG.  Set to Dolby headphone and dh1 (reference room) with the low end of the eq bumped a hair.  I can tell left and right but I rely heavily on the hit indicator around the cross hairs and what is going on around me.  I do hear helicopters and jets fly over, better than I did with a 7.1 pc setup.  The jury is out on positional audio and dolby headphone until I try a game that isn't BF.  I'm loving it so far.Looks-  These are some ugly headphones, so I thought.  The cream color and wood accents are down right silly IMO.  In person though, they don't look bad at all.  Very subtly done and looks good, don't let the pictures fool you.  If I had the option to rock some normal black/grey gear or these, I'd pick the looks of the hd598s.  Very reserved even though it brings one back to the days of old smoke stained cream PCs.You've read the better reviews already.  In my opinion these things rock and look sexy to boot.  If you are considering them for gaming I say go for it.  I'm happy with my purchase.","11 6, 2011",Sound bleed / gaming,1320537600,Electronics

"Interviewing a musician on my blog recently (Steve Poltz) about his musical influences threw up some great new music for me to try. I promptly bought a selection of the music he suggested and Glen Gould playing Bach: The Goldberg Variations was one of the of these.This is a pared back recording of Gould playing each short piece in turn and the sound of just Gould and a piano is especially soothing. The playing is technically proficient and showcases Gould's skill and nuanced touch to full effect.This has a selection of outtakes at the end as well where you can hear Gould recording some tracks and receiving some guidance from the producer. You can also hear Gould (who has Aspergers syndrome) humming along in the background, which to my mind actually adds to the recording. Some people don't like this, but I feel it adds a human touch to what could be quite a clinical piece otherwise.This is the remastered 1955 recording which launched Gould's talents to the wider world and whilst there isn't much new for those who have the existing performance, the sound here is clear and crisp and the outtakes add a certain element, even if just for curiosity.Poltz recommended this as his ideal dinner party background music and I am inclined to agree. It is subtle, but with enough depth to reflect upon if you so wish. It is unobtrusive and meticulously played and if you wish to give this a try I can heartily recommend it. I have enjoyed it immensely since I bought it and anticipate continuing to do so over the coming years.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.","06 10, 2011",Goldberg Variations,1307664000,CDVinyl

"Five FIRST-RATE Stars! This Friendly Swede ""Dark Blue Themed"" Bundle has 5 different keyboard covers in the multi-pack: 1 totally blue keyboard cover, 2 blue and white keyboard covers with differing attractive patterns, 1 keyboard cover with 6 colors in horizontal strips, of which 2 are blue;  and 1 totally clear keyboard cover for those who want to clearly see the keys without patterns or colors. The letters, numbers, and symbols of each key are clearly marked on each different cover and are of normal dimensions. Typing on the covers takes about a day to adjust to the tactile feel: the keys are fully responsive. The covers fit snugly on top of the computer keys without actually totally encasing each key, however each key is raised. For lighted keyboards, soft light comes through around the edges of the keys. The cover perfectly fits my MacBook Air and MacBook computer keyboard layouts as well as perfectly fitting the general keyboard outline. It does not hinder the closing of the computer tops. My typing speed is normal with these. The raised 'index finger orientation bars' on the J and F keys are present on all covers except for 1 key out of the entire bundle. These are the best keyboard covers I have tested, should keep debris out of the keyboard area underneath, and they are Highly Recommended. Five USEFUL Stars! (5 Friendly Swede keyboard covers, a soft cleaning cloth, and a re-closeable plastic storage case.

"Did you play Sniper Elite v2?If not that is okay, this is a stand alone game. But if you did, you understand the mechanics of the game, and how some of those missions had a survival aspect as some waves of enemies came at you.Well, this is really no difference, but with zombies. And zombies are fun.I am a big fan of COD Zombies, and this seemed like a cheap rip off at first, but it really is it's own thing. It is the Sniper Elite game mentality and you shoot the zombies. No running circles, no magic box for power weapons, but instead you have to dig in, try to search bodies for ammo (but the bodies disappear after a little bit), so the mentality and strategies are different.It really is a lot of fun, and can be played single player or coop with up to 3 people (4 total).I am impressed with how much fun it is and is simple enough to just jump in, but complex enough that you might want to strategize a bit to ensure you survive.It is a little repetitive in design. Hold out in the building, hold out in the courtyard, run to the safe house. Hold out in the building, courtyard, safe house etc... But overall it is fun and worth going through it.I highly recommend the game. It isn't perfect, but it is loads of fun.

This film gots itself a lot of hype from getting an Oscer so I figured I should watch it because sometime.  Except that the movie theter is about 100 miles away in Birmingham.  Since I couldn't get their in time and it would mean missing my NASCAR race I decided to dream watch the movie insted.  That's when I don't really watch it but I watch it in my dream insted.So I had 3 or 4 budwisers and than went to bed.  Since the movie is black and white I dreamed it from like I was a dog because dogs see in black and white.  Since I was just watching I dont think it made a difference if I watched as a person or as a dog since the movie would be the same ether way.I give the movie 1 star because it was'nt very good in my dream.  What I rememmber was there was this guy in black and white and he had dark hair.  Then there was this girl in black and white to.  They spent most of there time driving a Hummer back and forth to church.  I'm not sure why.

"I have played all the Brothers in Arms (BIA) games (Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30andBrothers In Arms: Earned in Blood) and I like this one the best. I am a fan of the squad based combat system that BIA uses. But, in the earlier games there were gameplay flaws that detracted from the game enjoyment. Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway (BIA:HH) delivers the whole experience. I also liked that BIA finally left Normandy. This is the first FPS game to tackle Operation Market Garden, a battle I have been fascinated by sinceClose Combat 2: A Bridge Too Farcame out.So what's new with BIA:HH. The biggest difference is accuracy is greatly improved (while cover is still effective, now you can actually shoot your weapon straight). The graphics and sound are also vastly improved from the previous games bringing it on par with Call of Duty and Medal of Honor series. BIA:HH also uses a new integration with cover. Once you ""dig in"" behind an object, you can peek out around it or over it to attack your enemies. This was a neat alternative to simply leaning or moving from crouch to standing position. It was easier to control and seemed more realistic. The only thing I didn't like was that when you peek around cover, you can zoom in, but your iron sites do not come up. When you play with target crosshairs visible this is not a big deal, but on authentic mode you have to rely on seeing where your bullets strike which was nearly impossible.You can now hop over small obstacles instead of going around or being blocked completely. There are still limits to the map, but the freedom is more expansive than most other games. The environment is now destructible. That little picket fence will no longer protect you from MG fire. Basically anything made of wood, sand bag emplacements (by bazooka), and vehicles can be destroyed; however, stone walls cannot be damaged (even by 88's).The suppression system still there which is good. But, several other things have been changed like the squad commands. Now when you are behind cover the view elevates slightly to allow you to select positions and enemy targets better than before. There is no more situation awareness view (replaced with map screen), but I always thought this was a little unrealistic and detracting from gameplay anyways. You now have an option to sprint though it has limitations (cannot turn directions much or fire your weapon). There is also cool new squads including bazooka squads and .30 cal MG teams. These add a lot more action and options to combat and improve the gameplay. There is also a special slow motion zoom in feature when you make a perfect head shot or when you order your bazooka to destroy infantry emplacements. These add a dramatic effect and there is plenty of gore to go around (this can be toned down for the light of heart). In a couple of missions you get to command a tank. This works different than the previous BIA games as you can actually direct the tank fire; however, during these missions you cannot exit the tank and don't get to have supporting infantry fire teams. It is still a nice change of pace though.There are some things that I'm not too excited about. The health system is extremely different. The screen turns red as your danger level increases, but only one shot is necessary to put you in a hole. Danger level fades as you take cover or are no longer under fire. In effect, it is like the health system introduced in Call of Duty 2 which I also didn't like. You also still can't go into prone position. And the extras are not as cool as before. There are no after action reports and pictures in the recon reports are too small and require you to find them on a map and hit a key to view them.The storyline and cut scenes seem to get mixed feedback. I think the cut scenes are extremely well done and add to the immersion into the game and the history. I think the game gives you enough of the previous events so that you don't have to play the previous games; however, playing at least the first one would be better. There were a couple parts that were a bit too much (missions chasing after Frankie), but in general the storyline followed the actual events of Operation Market Garden well. However, I would have liked to see more of the rest of Operation Market Garden in the 82nd Airborne and British 1st Airborne theatres. If you are interested in reading about Operation Market Garden, I would highly recommend reading Cornelius Ryan'sA Bridge Too Far.Technical Note: The game played great both on Windows 7 (Intel  i 7, 12 GB RAM, 2GB Nvidia Video Card) and Vista (Intel Core 2 Quad, 8GB RAM, 1GB Nvidia Video Card) for me.","12 31, 2013",A Major Leap Ahead from the First Two in the Series,1388448000,VideoGames

"I purchased the new 2012 Mac Mini a few weeks after it was introduced.  I assumed that there wouldn't be any problems with it because Apple quality is so high.  However, I was wrong.  I found out quickly that the HDMI output has a design flaw that has yet to be fixed by Apple.  This is not unique to my machine, but reported by many users. The problem is that the display goes blank or the whole screen displays snow or fuzz.  Sometimes the display will return to normal after a few seconds, and sometimes I have to power cycle the display before it will come back.  The problem occurs at different intervals, and happens perhaps once every 2 to 30 minutes.  Right now, the only solution I'm aware of is to use the Thunderbolt port and buy a separate adapter for Thunderbolt to DVI.  Apple sells them for $30 or you can buy lower cost versions on e-Bay.  Unfortunately for me, I wanted the Mac Mini to run 2 displays, and now I can only run one because the HDMI port is useless.If you are curious about how many other people are seeing this issue, you can google ""Mac Mini Display Problems 2012"" and that should take you to the Apple discussion forums with that problem listed.What bothers me most about this problem is that Apple doesn't seem to want to acknowledge this as a real problem (at least, as of today 11/27/2012).  It's probably their normal procedure to keep quiet until a solution is found, but this bothers me personally.If it wasn't for the display problems, I'd probably give the Mac Mini 5 stars because it's nice in almost every other way.  Too bad, Apple really dropped the ball on this one.12/11/2012 Update:Prior to 12/10, I could not find anything from Apple that showed that they publicly acknowledged this issue.  However, on 12/10, they released an update (1.7) with the following description: ""This update addresses HDMI video flicker issues on Mac mini (Late 2012) computers and is recommended for all users.""  The download is here: [...]I installed the update yesterday and after multiple hours of use, I have not seen the flicker problem return.  It's too early to tell if this problem is truly gone or not and the Apple forums still have threads of people complaining that the flicker problem still exists for them (in some cases it got worse).  The Apple support thread that I've been following is here: [...]For me, at least for the moment, I am a satisfied customer.  I am keeping to my word and moving my rating to 5 stars.  The Mac Mini is really a terrific product.To Apple: Thank you for addressing the issue. In the future, please own up to the issue sooner and publicly so that your stores/salespeople and support staff are all aware.

I work in IT, and we've been using Seagate hybrid drives as upgrade drives for a while.  They do provide a significant performance boost, and at much less cost than a true SSD drive.In my wife's case, I pulled her existing drive out of the laptop, and imaged it onto the new drive, making an exact clone (image). I have access to a hardware based disk duplicator at my office to do this.  For people who don't have a device like that, you can use any of several imaging softwares to do it. Basically you would attach the new drive to a USB port on the laptop using a SATA to USB adapter (there are several of those available cheaply on Amazon), and then run the software to image the old drive onto the new one.  Or you could find a computer repair shop to do it for you.Once the new drive is installed into the laptop, only a partition the same size as the old drive is available. Fortunately Windows 7 and above will let you expand the existing partition into blank space to give you the full size of the drive.  We kept the old drive, there was nothing wrong with it, it was just full. Basically it serves as a perfect backup of her drive at that moment in time. Of course those videos and pictures just keep coming, and as a backup, it is already badly out of date.Only four stars because the speed boost really isn't as much as you might hope, but it is still worth the minor extra cost of this drive.","04 3, 2014",Bought to replace a full laptop drive,1396483200,Electronics

"For starters, I have played and still own every major Resident Evil game in the series including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Code Veronica, all of them being on the GameCube except RE5. One of the best video game series of all times. This game was released as a 2-disc GameCube exclusive.Story: While the original RE game starts with the Alpha team's story, Bravo team was sent in first but their story was never explained. The main character, Rebecca Chambers was just a helper in RE but now you get to find out what her story was and how she survived while the rest of the Bravo team did not. Bravo team is called in to investigate a series of grisly murders in the Arklay Mountains region outside of Raccoon City, same as the Alpha team later on. On the way to the scene, Bravo's helicopter malfunctions because of a sabotage and is forced to crash land in the forest. The team soon discovers an overturned military police transport truck, along with the mutilated corpses of two officers. The remaining bravo team members split up and Bravo team's field medic, Rebecca Chambers, finds a train stopped in the middle of the forest. She discovers the prisoner, Billy Coen that was being transported by the military police. The train starts moving uncontrollably. The two work together from then on, stopping the train before it crashes and discovering an underground research facility owned by Umbrella. Things aren't what they seem as they explore the facility, fighting all the creatures and insects from Umbrella's experiments. The game ends at the entrance to the mansion from the first RE game.Gameplay: Single player survivor horror. You control both Billy Coen and Rebecca Chambers, each having their own unique abilities and each needed to solve puzzles and advance the plot. The storage containers are gone from the original RE game so if you need an item and your inventory is full, you then drop an item and it is tracked on your map in case you need to go back and get it. Fighting is the same as the other RE games. You can shoot from a stationary position only. The weapons include various custom handguns, shotguns, magnums, sub-machine guns, grenade launchers, and close-combat knives. As for the characters abilities, you need to use Rebecca to mix chemicals and get into tight spaces (she is petite) while you need Billy to move large objects and use a lighter. The enemies include mutant insects, zombies, primates, and leeches.Conclusion: Controls are easy to use. Sound and graphics are both on par for GameCube quality. If you love the RE series, you will like this game. There are multiple difficulty settings and the game is quite challenging on the standard difficulty. Worth picking up if you still own a GameCube or it can be played on the Wii using a GameCube controller and memory card.","10 18, 2011",A worthy prequel and GameCube exclusive to the great RE series,1318896000,VideoGames

It just HAS some music by the Pink Floyd. The soundtrack, such as it is, is utterly irrelevant; it might have benefitted from Tangerine Dream or Faust or some such.

But as far as the acting and how the movie unfolded, overall I think it could have been so much better.Many of the actors seemed to be just reading their lines in this film, with the exception of the man who played Murrow, I thought he did a good job. The story seemed rather disjointed and some things that were included didn't fit, in particular the jazz singer adding a song or two, along the way. That just seemed like an afterthought that didn't add anything, seemed kind of silly actually.I'm glad I watched it to see what the rave reviews were about but it's not memorable as far as the acting in particular.","07 5, 2014",Could Have Been a Lot Better,1404518400,MovieTV

"This thing is really amazing.  It has played everything I have thrown at it, even BD ISO files.  The Blu-Ray video (1080p 24 fps) and audio (DTS-HD MA and Dolby True HD pass through) is incredible.But...and this is a major but...this gadget is not a plug-and-play device.  It must be configured to do what you want it to do and that is not always intuitive or easy.  The included instructions are inadequate to show you how to set up much and even the downloadable user's guide only covers the basic functions, but...and this is a grateful but...there is a wonderful online wiki site that will answer anything you need to know.  Just be prepared to spend some time doing your research.  Because the PCH C-200 is so versatile and can do so many different things for so many different users...it is not a simple device.If you are an enthusiast and are tired of half baked functionality from media streamers then this may be what you are looking for.  I have owned three steamers previous to this one and have returned them all because they just wouldn't do the things I want.  PCH does all my wish list and more, but I had to work at it.  If you like to tinker, you will be very happy.  If you want to plug it in and expect more than basic streaming, it isn't happening...there are much cheaper products out there for that.The company frequently updates the firmware with bug fixes and features.  You will have to add some hardware depending on what you want it to do for you, for example a DVD drive or Blue Ray drive or a hard disk drive.  The price includes a Blue Ray license that is kept current thru the firmware updates.  The device is picky about what you attach to it or attach it to.  Examples include network switches or wireless dongles.  It deserves a full five stars but will probably only get it from the non-technically challenged.This equipment is the type that creates a cult-following among hobbyists.  Not your grandmother's media streamer but OMG, what a machine!12/2013 updateThis machine still continues to amaze me.  The software has been updated several times...primarily to cover the newer BD releases and fix a few bugs.  I simply love the full menu BD capability of this device.

"I prefer to use a stylus on my iPad unless I'm using the keyboard for taking notes in church. For surfing, gaming or reading Flipboard a stylus leaves my screen smudge-free with no fingerprints. After a few months the rubber tip starts to work loose and from then on the stylus is virtually worthless because it does not ""grab"" the screen consistently. The office stores sell styli for $10 to $15 which is not too bad if they would last indefinitely. Rather than buy locally I checked Amazon and was surprised to find that most styli come in packs of 6 to 10 but the prices are quite affordable.

"Ridley Scott is an amazingly talented director, and this is an admirable return to horror/sci-fi for him. I wish I'd seen it in 3-D, but I was too eager to get the HD download to wait for the Blu-Ray (and I  missed it in theaters). There are some questionable casting decisions that bothered me, specifically casting Noomi Rapace as an English scientist named Emma Shaw, I think, when she's only been speaking English for about a year. It would have taken little more than a five minute search and replace function in the script to make her a Swedish scientist working in an international operation and then she might have spent less effort trying to get an accent right. She's a brilliant actress,(The Swedish Stiege Larson trilogy) and in the latter 45 minutes of the movie, when so much of the acting is physical, you can absolutely see why she was cast, but why they made her English seems like giving her an extra stone to carry when it wasn't necessary. Likewise Idris Alba, who is almost always terrific, and successfully played a Baltimore gangster for five years on The Wire without a hitch in the accent, is cast as, I guess, a Texan. He was credible, but there was no reason not to give him a Cockney or Northern English Accent if you needed him to be working class.(He plays the captain of the ship.)You don't care about any of that. It's a fun, flashy, sci-fi horror movie with first-rate actors. It's not quite as scary and atmospheric as Alien, but it's cool to look at. You'll be tempted to try to think too hard, and a lot of people who saw it said they found it confusing, but it does resolve and explain itself by the very end, so just sort of hang on for the ride and think, ""I'm watching a monster movie, not a philosophical treatise."" And thank your alien gods that Scott didn't put Russell Crowe in it. If you haven't seen Alien, then you might want to give it a look before you watch this film, although the intervening 30 years or so between the films will stand out.","10 27, 2012",Wish I'd seen it in 3D,1351296000,MovieTV

"When comparing external hard drives, a couple of factors merit specific discussion. They are speed, capacity, noise level, durability, ease of installation, price and any add-ons.Speed: A bottleneck is simply the slowest part of any given system and every system has one. Chances are that this drive will be one of the faster components of your computer system. USB 3.0 drives are faster than previous generations, but make sure that your computer is equipped with a USB 3 slot - you can tell the difference by looking at the plug; USB 3.0 plugs have BLUE colored plastic on the inside and/or outside. If you don't have a USB 3.0 plug, don't worry too much - the latest versions are backwards compatible - though you won't get the full speed benefits of this device. Then again, most users won't ever need the full speed potential of USB 3.0, but it's nice to have for some specific tasks such as backing up your computer or transferring large files to your laptop.Capacity: 2 TB is a lot of storage, unless you spend months downloading thousands of full-screen HD videos. This drive provides enough storage capacity for MOST people to make a complete backup of multiple home computers and to store lots of other data as needed.Noise level: this drive is VERY quiet. I have had other drives which can be easily heard from 2-3 feet away. This drive is completely silent at 1-2 feet.Durability: It's too early to tell at this moment. I have had no problems so far, but I'll write back more in a year when the warranty is up.Ease of installation: You can't get any easier. Plug it in, and it installs itself. Your hard drive will appear and you can move content right away with no additional software or configuration required.Add-ons: Seagate offers other products that include their own back-up software, but this device comes with no additional software. Then again, most people don't really need any additional software so this isn't a big loss. I also picked up aSeagate Backup Plus 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STCA2000100, which does include backup software. If you plan on using an external drive for backup, buy that version as the price difference is only $10 or so - much cheaper than 3rd party backup software.One other reviewer mentioned heat. It's not a particularly important issue for most people to worry about. This device does not get particularly hot, even with continuous use. Are there more expensive drives with advanced cooling features? Yes.

"I am in a one person IT shop so I don't have a lot of time to babysit our environment. Always needing to count on things to run. When I came into this job, our backups were going to USB 2.0 external drives on our server. They were very slow and one day, when it crashed our server, I was able to convince ownership of a NAS. We also had an old SNAP server what was about on it's last leg. Constant problems and a very difficult interface. I was able to salvage about 80% from it and I had to search for a new option. Again, I convinced them to get a NAS. After some research, I decided to get two Seagate Black Armor NAS 440 units and by my experience, these devices are fantastic.The devices are easy to set up and do work with active directory to set permissions, especially comes in handy for our archive NAS. Backups were faster though still a little slow (takes most of an evening and overnight to complete them.) I wanted to take advantage of the USB ports on the NAS units to handle our offsite copy of the backups to external drives but this is where the unit fails. The software seems to quit updating the progress and most of the times just stops copying. I had to get another method to get our offsite copies. This wasn't a show stopper but it would be nice to take advantage of everything on this NAS>The only problem I ever had was I had a drive fail on bay 1. Called Seagate and it was a painless process to get a replacement drive under warranty. Oddly enough, it happened again on the same by, and again, the process was painless. Since then, NO problems. These units run 24/7 and are reliable.I can't recommend this unit enough for a small business and with growing media archives for the home user, I recommend to the home user as well.","05 22, 2013",Ideal For A Small Business,1369180800,Electronics

"Amazing piece of machinery and technology. I am a newbie, never flew RC anything before. I own a GoPro Hero3 camera and wanted desperately to shoot some aerial photography and video. Upon searching one day in late November, I found the DJI website and videos of the soon to be released Phantom and I was hooked. I pre-ordered mine through DSLRPros and was somewhat surprised when I saw it on Amazon, which shows it being fulfilled by DSLRPros. Odd, since I pre-ordered mine directly from DSLRPros back in December before it was officially released, yet many people on Amazon ordered theirs weeks after me and got them before I did. I wasn't happy about that, but I've got it now and it is awesome. It really is a breeze to fly.., yet I have already broken a prop or two and am looking for some replacement parts. Two extra props are included, thankfully. (Note: I crashed while flying at night in a pretty stiff breeze landing on my deck.., and I am a novice.., only busted 1 prop. It looks like you can get 2 props for around $3.., so they are reasonable...,I plan to attach my GoPro Hero3 camera tomorrow.., now that I have some time logged actually flying the copter. Wish me luck!If you decide to get one.., take the time to watch the setup videos and read the manual first, there are some setup steps before first flight and a process to getting her airborne.., simple, but make sure you understand. The video isn't obvious about how to turn the motors on, but the manual (which is online only; no instructions included) does provide more details.AT this price, it is hardly a 'Toy', yet it will make you feel young again!

I loved seeing Madea and Hattie Mae together again. Why only 4 stars? Well, there are some things that he needs to work on like too many songs and tying up loose ends when it comes to the story.

"I use so many USB-to-microUSB cables that I've begun to have a few favorites, and I now count this Frieq cable among them.  The cloth jacketed cable (more on the wrap later) doesn't tangle, and it curls nicely into a coil for storage.  It charges everything I need -- Kindle, Bluetooth headset, external batteries -- without problem.  I like the six-foot length, too, for when I want to use a device that I'm in the process of charging, although the length can have its issues when you don't need the length; I leave mine coiled when I'm charging on my desk.  The connections between cable and ends seems sturdy, unlike some of my other cables.  The wrap protects the inner wire by preventing kinks and inhibiting damage from sharp objects.For better or worse, this is not a stealth cable.  Although the bright blue and yellow colors make it easy to find in my bag of cables, the cable is not exactly the kind of low-key look most of us have come to expect with electronic accessories.  In general, Frieq's products tend toward a more edgy look (think of the name), and this cable makes its statement with the colors.  After all, the cable would work just as well with a black fabric wrap.  I happen to like it, but not everyone will.

"This is the story of a computer builder who would not heed the signs, nor read the reviews carefully.In September of last year (2010), I purchased a Sapphire Radeon HD 4550 for an HTC which I was putting together in my living room. It was quiet, it was quick, it was O.K. for the size and price on HD reproduction over Netflix. Then sometime in February, I started to get the BSOD. It happened over and over until the computer would not boot up. I placed the card in an open slot in an older PCIE; no go. It was dead. I figured one in a thousand. I had seen the Radeon HD 5770 at a good price at Amazon and I had some credits in my Amazon Visa account. I bought it.I upgraded the power supply. I upgraded the CPU. I added two gigs of memory. It worked beautifully....for three months.... I bought it in April, it was out by the beginning of July. Forget about bang for the buck. This one doesn't even charge for the bang. Stay away from Sapphire....at least for now. AMD has to sort it out with them. It looks like bad quality control. The new card has been purchased from Amazon, and is shipping as we speak.

"Watching some of these post-cold war thrillers recently, I have been struck by how closely they hew to the basic structure of  the earlier period, changing only the conflicting national labels to other nations or to organizations with and among nations. The International is a good example, as a trans-national bank substitutes for the Soviet Union and various law enforcement agencies to the British MI-5 and American CIA. Just a thought. What is more relevant is the fact that this is a most watchable movie, good acting, dramatic action scenes, tightly knit script with only a relatively few flaws, and, always a source of pleasure, a sense of place, as if one was in NYC, Paris and other cities of note. I would think anyone with an inclination towards international intrigue and the sense of being behind the public facade will  find the movie quite entertaining.","07 13, 2013",Updating the Cold War Thriller,1373673600,MovieTV
"Works perfectly on our iphones and 3rd gen. ipad.  With the learn button feature, we were able to program our tv, dvd player, xbox, media player, sony audio receiver, oscillating fan, and portable window air conditioner.  There is a real learning curve, but once you get it, its fun.  You can spend hours configuring each controller just the way you like. I like that once the transmitter is plugged in, it opens the app automatically and remembers where you last controlled.  very responsive although it does need to be aimed in the general direction of the device.  Xbox worked alright, but i would never play a game using it. but for movies and basic navigation it works.  The best feature is the macro.  I can press media player all on and it turns on my tv, then the media player, then the audio receiver for surrond sound, then changes the TV source input to the media players, and then the audio receiver follows suit and changes it to the media player as well, all with one button.

The G11 definitely produces great picture results, but Canon have crammed so many features in that they have struggled to get the handling right. There are several dials and buttons close to the edges of the camera which are too easy to accidentally knock, and you need tiny fingers to operate some others effectively.

"I run an unRAID system and purchased one of these because I kept having lock ups/crashes while transferring data. It seemed to only occur when running very large transfers and I got the feeling it had something to do with the Realtek NIC on the motherboard. I picked one of these up and installed it and haven't really had an issue since (there were some hiccups but I think the problem also stemmed from some poorly setup shares).Anyways, if you need a second NIC this is a great choice. However you might want to get the regular PCI version (I'm wishing that I did). The bandwidth on a PCI slot is more than enough to support a Gigabit connection and won't take away from valuable PCIe slots that you might use for things like SAS expander cards and what not.Also, if you're running unRAID, remember that it will only notice one NIC, so if you want to use this you need to disable the onboard NIC in the BIOS.","05 8, 2013",Cheap.

Get over here, Smee!""Though it's one of my favorite lines of the whole movie, that above quote does bring up some points to be aware of. First, while this is a children's movie, it does carry a PG rating and there is some swearing in the movie. If you're the type who categories swearing into ""major"" and ""minor"" swear words, these would all be of the ""minor"" category, but they are there, nonetheless. There are also some darker plot themes here - kidnapping, murder, suicide, guns, sword fights, etc. That might sound bad written out like that, but it's no worse than the Looney Tunes episodes we grew up with. If there's such a thing as good ol' fashioned comedic shooting and sword fights, then Hook ranks among the best.I'd consider it a must-see for any fan of Peter Pan stories, kids of the 80's and 90's, parents of kids of the 80's and 90's, and Dustin Hoffman fans.Side note: Julia Roberts was only 24 when she made this movie.

"I have the New iPad (aka the iPad 3) and my mom has the Kindle Fire so I have used that as well.  I would have to say that overall the Galaxy Tab 2 has worked great.  I received it about three days ago and I really like it.  I like my iPad but I always thought it was a little too big.  I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited.  I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" looked right for the price.  It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3.  The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad.  Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250.  I like the android ice cream sandwich OS.  It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire.  The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive.  I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen.  It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already.  I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one.  It is front and back.  There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card.  That is a plus over the Fire.  I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play.  Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me.  The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste.  The sound is better and louder with headphones.  With headphones it sounds pretty good.  The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket.  You wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad.  As far as android play store, I am new to it.  I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store.  There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks.  As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise.  You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either.  There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up.  Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want.  I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case.  Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly.  I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets.  That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds.  Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet.  You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs.  However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550.  I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3"" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though.  The 7"" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet.  I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7"".  You can wait until July when supposedly a 7"" Google Asus tablet will be released for $200.  It is supposed to have better specs.

"I have an Optoma ML500 projector. I chose this mount because it is ""universal"". I got the mount all put together and mounted to the ceiling. I used the extension to make it lower and that worked fine to. Now I had to mount the bracket to the projector itself. With my projector that was hard to do. But I finally got that to work also. My biggest complaint is that when I mounted the projector to the mount on the ceiling, I noticed I had it on backwards. So I think, ""well, I'll just spin this around and be set"". WRONG - it doesn't spin. I looked at every section I could think of and it doesn't spin. Now, I had to take off the mount on the projector and face it as close to forward as I could. I set it back on the ceiling mount and secured it. Then I had to twist the mount to get it to fit right on my screen. I was disappointed, but I got it to work. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. It works like it should and will hold my projector up as long as I want it to. But if I ever move it, I will have to buy another one.

"A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5"" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a ""I love my SSD"" sticker.Write performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes (""dd"" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5"" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place.The ""sweet spot"" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious).The OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage.A fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba.

"This box includes Herbert von Karajan recordings of Strauss orchestral works from 1972 through 1986.  I'll review only those works that I am particularly fond of and comment on better performances that Karajan may have made.  Where possible, I will also provide comparisons to recordings by Rudolf Kempe, specifically Kempe's remastered Strauss Complete Orchestral Works (SCOW).Also Spoke Zarathustra is a rather unexciting version of the well-known work taken at a slower tempo than in Karajan's earlier years.  I much prefer the brilliantly-remastered, more emotionally-charged 1973 recording on DG 474 281.  Kempe's remastered 1971 version on Strauss Complete Orchestral Works (SCOW) is rough sonically and less enjoyable.  Karajan wins.Don Juan is vividly recorded but is interpretively laid-back compared to the remastered 1972/3 Don Juan which is more exciting (also on DG 474 281) .  Kempe's 1973 SCOW is a close runner-up but not quite as vividly recorded nor as tranlucent as Karajan 1973 (in spots, however, Kempe's brass are astonishing).The 1986 Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks is less intense and exciting than his 1973 remastered version on the aforementioned DG disc, although the 1986 version benefits sonically from its digital recording and has a slight edge over the 1973 version in that regard only.  1986 Till comes across as naughty whereas the 1973 version is more menacing.  Kempe's 1970 recording of Till is also a vivid and exciting one.  Kempe seems to find a less malignant prankster in Till.  Both conductors seem to me equally committed in their divergent but equally valid perspectives.  Both 1973 Karajan and 1970 Kempe share superb sonics (Karajan may have a slight edge, though) and I found them equally enjoyable.  Try to get both.The 1973 Dance of the Seven Veils from Salome is on both the box under review as well as the DG two-disc album and what a vivid, sultry performance Karajan gives.  You can almost see... well, enough said.  Kempe's Salome is from 1970 and although excellently played and almost as vividly recorded, his interpretation is not nearly as sultry as Karajan.Both the box under review and the DG two-disc album share the 1980 An Alpine Symphony.  It is glorious, sublime, powerful, and intense.  This is one of the greatest recordings ever made of any classical work.  To me, Strauss never composed a more emotional and thematically complex work in his life.  As an ode to the majestic beauty of the nature he watched and mountains he hiked through while growing up in Bavaria, I consider it equaled only by Beethoven's Ninth and Mahler's Eighth, all three of which are monuments to the vastness of what exists outside of ourselves and testaments to the highest we can achieve from within.  Under lesser conductors, Alpine Symphony can meander aimlessly.  In contrast, Karajan sees the path ahead and takes us through the mountains while giving us time to savor the beauty along the way.  The soundscape is amazingly stunning.  There are no criticisms possible here.  It is as near perfect a recording of perfect music as I have ever heard.  Kempe's 1971 Alpine Symphony is almost as impressive.  It is recorded with a closer listener perspective and is only slightly less compelling.  I think that Karajan is able to demonstrate more emotional intensity than Kempe, and his sonics are the icing on the cake.Both the box and the 2-disc album also share Strauss's melancholic Four Last Songs.  They receive sublime performances by Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  The sound is exemplary and Karajan led his Berliners in a very supportive and rich accompaniment.  Strauss wrote the songs at a time in his life when he had become convinced that his life had contributed nothing significant to the world.  You can clearly hear the anguish and despair with hints of hopeful absolution in the emotionally-laden set.I have reviewed only a few representative works from the DG Collector's Edition of Strauss Orchestral Works, but I hope they are adequate for the reader's purpose.  While some of the works have been received better performances by Karajan earlier, some of them ARE the best of Karajan.  One very special benefit to the box is the heart-felt Metamorphosen, Strauss's reaction to the Allied bombings at the conclusion of WW II.The box is really self-recommending.  I would ecrtainly add the 2-disc DG album mentioned above for a better Zarathustra, Don Juan, and Till Eulenspiegel.","04 11, 2014",Worth every penny if only for the astonishingly superb Alpine Symphony!!!,1397174400,CDVinyl

"This is my 9th or 10th iPad case/cover - I had an iPad 2 and now have an iPad 3rd gen. There are some great pluses to this cover but also some negatives.Positives:- Slim profile - Love the slim profile that does not add extra bulk to my iPad. It also keeps it lightweight and easier to carry in a bag or purse without adding too much bulk.This is the biggest plus for me. I have other leather covers and other book type covers that are much nicer but add too much weight and bulk and make the iPad to heavy for my purse and also tiring to read. This is the reason I ended up using this cover more than I anticipated.- Fabric is stain and liquid resistant - It repels light stains, and some moisture as I found when I spilled some coffee over a countertop and a few drops reached the iPad. It probably can't repel a whole glass of orange juice or coffee though!- The fabric covers the bezel of the iPad - Initially I hated it as it ruins the beauty of the iPad but I found it was easier to hold the iPad with this cover as it makes it less slippery and also prevents finger prints which can be a menace with the shiny glass surface of the iPad.- Magnetic cover puts iPad to sleep when closed and wakes when opened. This is becoming pretty standard in most covers but is a nice feature.- Using the origami fold felt a little odd in the beginning, but it feels pretty stable to stand up the iPad as well as lay it down - a little better than the Apple iPad Smartcover. iPad topples easily when stood up with the Smartcover - this is a little more stable in comparison but not as stable as some other covers.- Does not leave stains or lines on the glass surface like the Apple iPad Smartcover which has suede inside.- Fit - It fit the iPad 3rg gen like a glove. The iPad 2 might be slightly loose. It is certainly not meant to be taken off every day.Negatives:- Not very attractive to look at - is a plain swath of fabric in one color and it can almost feel as if the iPad is bundled up in some cloth. It also hides the bezel which takes away from the beauty of the iPad.- Protection - This cover will prevent scratches but won't offer the protection some padded cases offer. However, those can be bulky to use.- Offers only 2 angles for tilting - some other designs offer more options.- Does not have any elastic bands to secure cover to iPad like some other covers.Overall, there are 100s of covers available for the iPad at this time, and I would rate this one as average. It's biggest asset is the low profile and light weight. However, some other covers are available for much lower price and this cover seems a bit too pricey given the competition.Update March 2013 - After some gentle usage the cover has started to fray and peel off in places which is a pity as it had a lot going for it with its low profile and light weight and solid grip. I am downgrading the rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.","08 3, 2012","Slim case that prevents slippage, functional but not very attractive.",1343952000,Electronics

"The Good: Excellently crafted story, likeable characters, dialog choices are fun, engaging combat, deep customization and leveling, captures the Star Wars feel perfectlyThe Bad: Weird combat problems, ugly and dated visuals, stiff animations and some iffy voice acting, some dialog trees are just broken or off, every planet is laid out to similarlyBioWare is a company that revolutionized the action RPG genre for the western era. In a time where Japanese RPGs dominated the market, BioWare was sitting in a little studio churning out one of the best RPGs of all time. I remember when I was younger how much of a big hoopla this game was. For someone who didn't own an Xbox or a PC that could run the game it still slipped under my radar. I eventually got a chance to rent the game years later on 360 and quickly got bored due to its age. I finally picked it up again on the PC and I am glad I did. The game may feel very dated and old (an entire decade), but there's no denying the excellent story and well crafted atmosphere that truly feels genuine in the Star Wars universe.You play a custom character that has to defeat the evil Sith Lord Darth Malak. He has found some sort of Star Forge to use against the Republic, so you are shadowing his footsteps to find the Star Maps to this Star Forge. This takes you across several planets such as Tatooine, Dantooine, Kashyyyk, Korriban, Yevin, and even Taris. You acquire companions along the way of all types and endure some pretty tough battles and story choices. You have to constantly choose between the light and dark side during choices, and there's plenty of ways to go about the story.Firstly, you can choose any world in any order. Each one is roughly laid out the same with a large hub area then an area beyond where your main quest and some side quests lie. I got rather annoyed with the constant similar layouts and wished for variety. Each world has the Star Map area blocked off until you fix some global catastrophe on the planet. Some are so serious that your decision will determine if you are allowed back on later. Besides running around and talking to people to get quests and buy stuff, the combat and customization is fathoms deep; fans will be pleased.You can customize your character with a plethora of items such as implants, shields, different weapons from lightsabers, blasters, vibroblades, belts, armor, robes, headgear, and I haven't even started on leveling up. You should pick your character based on how you're going to fight. I chose to use melee weapons because you eventually go through Jedi training and get your first lightsaber. I have to say that this brought a smile on my face when I inserted my crystals and watched my character whip around those sabers with the classic lightsaber sounds. Nothing can top that.The game allows you to customize all your items by inserting upgrades that you find or buy. This is mandatory because there really isn't a ""most powerful weapon in the game"". You just get a powerful weapon and you have to upgrade it or it won't do you much good. Other than this there is the deep leveling system. You can choose an attribute, feat, power, and skill. Feats effect what you use physically in combat and what combat attacks you can use. Powers are force powers and there are plenty of them. All light and dark powers you can possibly think of are here. I had a lot of fun using them in combat and getting an edge over certain enemies. The level cap is at 20, but most people probably won't even hit that by the end. I finished at level 18 and didn't have too hard of a time finishing it. You can even choose how your companions level up because you can control them too! This is great for people who like a variety and can't have every skill available for your character.Combat is turned based with die rolling behind the scenes. I really would have like real-time combat, but what's here is exciting and fun on its own. There are tons of different enemies to fight on each planet, and some are harder than others. I found the game really hard at first, but after a while you will level up and find the game very balanced. There are some issues in combat that just really annoyed me. There seems to be a targeting problem in small areas. When you click your action you want the characters will get stuck in an endlessly looping animation if there is someone in their way. This can cause you a battle because you have to disengage and restart the attack or move around the obtrusion. This happened quite a lot, but you will learn to just live with it.While the story is interesting and choosing how dialog will change it is fun, there are some issues here. Instead of your choice being final, some dialog trees will allow you to go back and change your answer or no matter how you persuade or force persuade neither will work and you can't continue the dialog. This is usually in side missions, but I have never seen the persuade option fail so much in a BioWare game. No matter how much I leveled up my persuasion attribute I failed an awful lot. Other than this though, my other issue is that some dialog just drags on way too long. I found myself skipping a lot of it or just reading ahead of the voices. These, again, are just minor issues that can be overlooked.The graphics in the game look old and terrible these days, but back in the day they looked amazing. I can see why it looked so good then, but you can still feel the Star Wars atmosphere and that's what counts the most. The character models and animations are stiff, blocky, and repeat a lot, but overall it works. Even some of the voice acting is spotty at best, but overall it is pretty good.KotOR is an amazing Star Wars experience, but the age may turn a lot of people off. My biggest issue of all is that the game doesn't give any clues on where to go ever. You get no hints and are left on your own to just figure out what to do. I had to use a walkthrough through most of the game because I had no idea where to go, or some quests were very cryptic. This is a huge no-no for me and really hurt the score the most. Overall, this is an amazing Star Wars game and any Star Wars fan will love this game.","08 21, 2012",One of the best Star Wars experiences to date,1345507200,VideoGames

"I love portable Bluetooth speakers, and have owned several models including the Logitech UE and the predecessor to this model, the Sony SRSBTX300, both of which are capable performers. After spending many hours listening to the Sony SRSX7, I would have to consider this speaker the cream of the crop. The sound is richer and more nuanced than the other two models, and is therefore more lifelike and less like something coming out of a small box. In this regard, the Sony SRSX7 is something of an engineering miracle--how did they put so much speaker into such a compact device?As expected at this price point, the Sony SRSX7 has all the bells and whistles a guy wants in a Bluetooth speaker these days--one-touch Bluetooth pairing with NFC, speakerphone capabilities, and a USB port on the back panel which allows you to charge your cell phone as you listen to music or use the speakerphone.This is a true five-star product.

"In late 1987 I recieved a sweet early Xmas present in the form of ""All the best"", which unexpectedly helped me a find a long lost song that took me years to rediscover titled ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" ( the ladder half is what I was looking for).after ward I was trying to collect McCartney's solo work, ( which unfortunatly I could not get into finishing)it was then I discovered the Ram lp, and loved this lp ever since, and it still stays a fresh piece of work to this date. And now finally the album gets it due. Like all the other reviews of this re-release, the remastering is clear and fresh and it's like discovering the album all over again, lots of people on this review are slightly disappointed in no demos on this release, but I am happy with the other bonus tracks on here that are included including the Another Day single with it's b side, and a few unreleased gems to go with it, and if you have downloaded this , also included are two bonus gems exclusivly added for the downloaded version,including a live recording of my favorite track Eat At Home,with Smile Away backed with the track, as well as a Uncle Albert demo, which is catchy.However due to everyone's claim about critics slamming this as well as Lennon's attacks on this release , everyone claims that McCartney went more towards the commercial side of his career, but how does one explain his followup release ""Wings Wild Life"" which was even more left field than Ram or even the McCartney release's ? Anyways, for those whose loved this album whether you discovered it when it was first released or later in life, then you will be very pleased with the results of this two cd set edition of RAM.","05 22, 2012",McCartney's best true solo effort gets a sweet makeover !!!,1337644800,CDVinyl

"My collection of Young Justice is finally complete from Season 1 to 2.This continues Season Two of Young Justice. The disks are two. The first one is dark blue and the second one is red. Both consist of five episodes each. Compared to the previous disks of Young Justice, the menu is different and simple. The main menu is the cover of the DVD disk. The rest of the screens once you go through them are just red. There are subtitles, and audio changes. There are three special episodes available and they are from Static Shock. It makes sense to add these episodes since Static Shock is a character introduced to the Young Justice world. His biography of his powers have changed. There wasn't enough time to really see Static Shock in Young Justice. From the episodes seen, Virgil is characterized as someone in my opinion: loyal, brave, and a teen who is okay with his powers and idolizes the heros at some moments. Besides Virgil, I really enjoyed seeing new characters such as Asami, Tye, and Ed. Then I saw the original Roy Harper become Arsenal. Everything came together. I saw a lot of characters in the spotlight and I wanted to see more moments from certain characters. I saw Zatanna and Rocket be totally awesome. I saw relationships develop. There was sisterly love between Jade and Artemis. There was a problem with Mal and Karen that started from the begining to the end. It showed the issue of growth. I didn't really understand Wonder Girl and Robin because it was so sudden. It was like whoa. Compared to the first season where all the relationships developed had a few hints here and there. That one was surprising. I really wanted to see Jaime reunite with Tye as himself.The season wrapped up pretty nicely done since there were only ten episodes. We learn more about Blue Beetle, the scarabs, the Reach, the War world and the characterization with a lot of characters. We see it all wrap up and show the madness to going undercover and solving the Blue Beetle. I really didn't expect the last episode since it closed the door and opened up a few more doors. I've seen a possible season three plot occur if the show does pick up again.It has been said that there is a possible resurrection of Young Justice if more products are bought concerning Young Justice such as the upcoming video game. No season three was ordered due to the lack of sales from action figures. Yes, action figures. It takes more to run the show with all the money it takes. if you have questions, you can look it up and see all the possible reasons why there is no season three.I bought the series since I buying it to view just online or on Itunes is more expensive and useless since I prefer using my DVD player or computer to view it.

"""Dick Tracy vs. Crime Incorporated"" is a 15 chapter Republic serial, the last of the four with Ralph Byrd as Dick Tracy, released in late December of 1941.  It is also the last of the 17 serials directed by the team of William Witney and John English.A mysterious criminal, known as ""The Ghost"" seeks revenge on members of the ""Council of Eight"" who helped send his brother, ""Rackets"" Regan, to the Chair.  They had planned to build a vast orgnization, called ""Crime, Incorporated"" which now The Ghost, secretly a member of the Council, will carry out alone, with the aid of an invisibility machine developed by his associate, Lucifer (John Davidson).  As the story begins, two members of the Council have already been killed, and Tracy arrives too late to save criminologist Dr. Stephen Chandler (Howard C. Hickman), killed at close range despite being heavily guarded.  While Tracy and the police are baffled, they had noticed an odd sound, caused by Lucifer's invisibility machine.  Tracy spends the next fourteen chapters tracking that sound, battling the Ghost's schemes and trying to learn his identity.For purposes of the serial the acting is fine, with Ralph Byrd as reliable as ever as the square-jawed detective/G-man, supported mostly by agent Bill Carr played by Michael Owen.  Instead of Gwen, the main female role is June (Jan Wiley), the daughter of the late Dr. Chambers, but she appears no more often than Gwen did in the other serials.  She finally gets to do something in Chapter Ten, analyzing the sound of Lucifer's machine.  Jan Wiley had better roles in Universal's 1945 serials ""Secret Agent X-9"" and ""The Master Key.""  The actors for the remaining members of the Council of Eight are Hooper Atchley, Robert Fiske, Robert Frazer, Ralph Morgan and John Dilson, all good at playing suspicious characters.  The Ghost is supported not only by John Davidson as Lucifer, but Anthony Warde as the main henchman John Corey.  A lot of familiar faces show up in smaller roles, including Edmund Cobb, C. Monague Shaw, Stanley Price, John Merton, Jack Mulhall and Edward Hearn, plus stunt men David Sharpe, Duke Taylor, Ken Terrell and Bud Wolfe.Those looking for a lot of action will not be disappointed, but little logic is used in solving the case, and Tracy seems to be waiting with the audience to see which Council member is left in the last chapter.  Screenplay writers Ronald Davidson, Norman S. Hall and Joseph Poland were also involved with the earlier ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" which had a similar ""Who Is.."" plot, but here Tracy is supposed to be protecting those Council members.  While there are no ""retrospective"" chapters, there's a lot of recycled footage.  The first chapter ends with the destruction of New York City by tidal wave, taken from the 1933 film ""Deluge,"" though the associated new footage doesn't quite look right.  Maybe the palm trees lining the streets were the wrong kind for New York.  Most chapters contain extra ""cliffhangers"" at the mid-point for added action, usually from an earlier serial, though often with a different resolution.  In the middle of Chapter Three the hero chases a runaway train in an army tank, from the second Dick Tracy serial.  Then we get a rerun of the first chapter cliffhanger from ""Dick Tracy's G-Men"" where a remote-controlled boat loaded with explosives is heading to destroy the canal locks.  To fit it into the story, a clumsy explanation is needed by Tracy, who is able to see from an airplane that dummies have been substituted for the people and that a remote-control unit is operating the boat.  Reuse of cliffhangers is not unusal in serials, but the amount of it is especially high for the time this one was made.  The ""scientific"" explanations related to The Ghost's invisibility don't enhance the credibility either, though there's entertainment in the rapid wearout of the tubes in Lucifer's machine.  Fortunately originality and plot aren't the only things that matter in serials, and Republic's production values are in top form, including the choreography of the fist fights and especially the musical score by Cy Feuer, the most pulse-pounding in the Dick Tracy serials.VCI's edtion on DVD, # 8526, is properly spread out on two discs, the first double-layer with chapters one through nine, the second disc having the remaining five chapters.  There is but one extra, an introduction by Max Allan Collins, who wrote the Dick Tracy comic strip from 1977 to 1993.  This is on the first disc but can only be accessed with the ""play all"" option; it does not appear on the main menu.  VCI's image is quite good, if from a reduction print, seen in the softness of focus toward the edges especially in the lower-right corner of the screen, with blurred words ""fictitious"" and ""coincidental"" in the disclaimer about the similarity to persons living or dead.  This is also the location of the MPPDA certificate numbers, and the one for Chapter Nine is quite blurry, though probably correct, like the ones for the other chapters.  But overall the sharpness, gray scale and lack of scratches and dirt are impressive.  The sound in Chapter One has some noise reduction artifacts causing the dialogue to be a little garbled, but VCI's videotape edition, # 1169 had the noise doing about the same thing.  The other chapters are better, clear enough if with some background hiss, a good compromise between noise and high-frequency enhancement.The other Dick Tracy serials are closer to the comic strip, with better atmosphere and plot development, and a lot less recycled footage.  Still, by Amazon's rating system ""Dick Tracy vs. Crime, Inc."" deserves five stars for the lively action and fine production values of the serial.  The blemishes are fairly minor, and this is the best-looking transfer of the four Dick Tracy serials on DVD.","06 5, 2012",The best transfer; a good if not the best Tracy serial,1338854400,MovieTV

Croft relishes the blood drinking, mauling, lifestyle and in between teaching classes, enjoys attacking women whenever he feels like it. Now grown up (William Smith) is not happy and relentlessly pursues his father. knowing he masquerades as a teacher, he finally joins the right class, goes on a field trip and while Croft is attacking the students, his son surprises him and they have a serious vampire to vampire confrontation. Although a low budget 70's production, this is very well made, with unrelenting creepiness, and brilliant performances from Michael Pataki and of course William Smith who is great in anything he does. The finale where Croft rounds up multiple victims for slaughter and the brutal fight is where this film really delivers the thrills! Grave of the Vampire is arguably more scary, twisted, and original than anything Hammer has ever done. Finally a great release of this film that appears to be uncut. 16x9 dvd video and audio has been well done. Extras are long combo trailer.","12 1, 2013","""Grave"" eclipses Hammer horror",1385856000,MovieTV

"Many have described Prometheus as Ridley Scott's attempt to take Alien to the level of Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001, and I think that's broadly a good assessment. However, while I found the film enjoyable, it never quite reaches the heights of either of its spiritual predecessors.MINOR SPOILERS BELOWWhen I first heard about the concept of aliens creating men, I was worried. However, it's important not to take the science in the film too seriously. Even Ridley Scott says this isn't a science class. It is kind of silly that these large humanoid aliens called the ""Engineers"" (or Space Jockeys for fans of the original Alien) created humans. The film even points out the ridiculousness of the concept when the biologist jokes it would throw out ""300 years of Darwinism."" In watching the movie, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the plot is a device to answer philosophical questions about the nature of God, creation, and death. The atmosphere and story during the first half of the movie is great.The acting is also surprisingly good. Other reviewers have gone on about how good the big three - Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron - are, so all I'll say is that I really enjoyed their performances. Fassbender's performance as the android is stunning in how calmly chilling he is. Some of his lines were so cruel, yet so innocently recited, that I want to rematch the movie just to see him. Most of the other characters I thought were fine, with some exceptions (particularly Noomi Rapace's character's husband who came off as a lame Ashton Kutcher wannabe).The problem with the movie is that its exploration of these themes and acting are hampered by action/horror scenes that clearly weren't well thought out. As other reviewers noted, many of the deaths are caused by characters making stupid decisions. Many reviewers have criticized the crew for taking off their helmets, which at first is fine because one would expect that alien microbes would not be able to infect humans. However, once it was apparent that the Space Jockey DNA was the same as humans AND that one of the crew members was infected, they still continue to take their helmets off! Other stupid decisions include the biologist's attempt to pet a snake; the captain's decision to open the ship's door when a crew member's signal is detected without receiving audio confirmation from him; and the fact that the characters can only run straight to avoid a rolling ship. Overall, the action scenes seem like they were a symptom of today's brain dead Hollywood.For me, the biggest drawback to the movie was pacing. The beginning was slow, which was fine by me. However, when the action starts, it never really slows down. The audience isn't given time to breathe and absorb. The tension never really builds. For example, after Noomi Rapace's infamous scene, she runs down the hallways and has a conversation with the crew, and then they go try to communicate with the Space Jockeys. First of all, the fact that Rapace's character doesn't even inform the other crew members about what happened to her is ridiculous. But then the movie switches gears so quickly that it's like it never happened. Rapace's character is clearly hurting from the encounter, but not as much as she probably would in real life.Another major problem is that the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I'm not an Alien fanboy - I don't need to know every detail about the Space Jockey's origins. However, major plot points that are (deliberately) left open, setting it up for a sequel. I like some mystery, but for most viewers the movie will seem incomplete or ridiculous. For example, as many other reviewers have noted, it seems pretty stupid for one of the Space Jockey's, presumably an intelligent alien species, to simply start killing humans, arguably an intelligent species, when he wakes up after sleeping for 2,000 years. The film hints that there might be a reason why the Space Jockeys hate humans so much, but you'd think he would at least be confused at seeing humans or worried that they were able to travel so far. As it is the Space Jockey's actions look more like Hollywood's attempt to throw in some mindless violence. Maybe it'll all make sense after we see the inevitable sequel, but too much of it just doesn't seem to have been thought through very clearly.Overall, if you like sci-fi, especially the Alien franchise, Prometheus is well worth seeing. Don't set your expectations too high, and be willing to accept some thoughtless plot points. I'd give the movie 3 stars. If Ridley Scott and his scriptwriters had put a bit more thought into the plot, it could have been so much more.UPDATE on Blu-Ray (10/15/12):My initial review was a bit harsh, but upon rewatching the movie I think it was eminently justified. While there are some interesting philosophical concepts, they're buried deep beneath stupid characters and poor scriptwriting. The contrast with Scott's Alien, which I also recently rewatched, is telling. Alien never pulled me out of the movie and the characters seemed utterly believable. It's just a shame Prometheus didn't quite work on that level.The blu-ray set comes with all the standard deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and commentaries. The deleted scenes are definitely the highlight. As happens so often, I wonder why they were deleted. The deleted version of the Fiefield fight uses a much more interesting Fiefield monster concept than the ugly guy we saw in the film. Also, Vickers has a few compelling character moments in the deleted scenes. Even the Engineer has more character. The deleted scene gives him a very compelling reason for attacking the Promtheus crew, whereas in the finished film he seems like a mindless brute. In short, Prometheus would have been a much better movie with these scenes incorporated.The 4-disc set comes with even more impressive special features, particularly the 3-hour ""The Furious Gods"". This is the documentary that the ads claim will ""answer"" the questions left from the film's plot holes. While that goes a bit too far, ""The Furious Gods"" is rich in content. I enjoyed hearing about the making of the movie, from beginning to end. It is definitely revealing, both in good ways and bad, However, I really don't like the idea of ""enhancement pods"", which essentially require you to interrupt the documentary in order to watch shorter featurettes. I'd have preferred if the short featurettes were simply part of the feature documentary.","06 10, 2012","Generally strong, except for a few of the action/horror scenes",1339286400,MovieTV

"I purchased this unit for my Mid-2011 27&#34; iMac / 2.7GHz i5 Quad-Core / 1 TB Hard Drive / 16 GB RAM (Self Upgraded) / 512 MB Video/Graphics.The main reason I purchased this unit is, well, because in my opinion, if you have a desktop computer you absolutely NEED some sort of battery back-up unit, because power failures/outages WILL happen. Not to mention, brown-outs, where the voltage drops to an unusable level. The only time I would really say that you don't absolutely need a battery back-up is if you have a laptop, as they have built in batteries obviously, which will prevent it from doing a hard destructive shut-down with loss of power. Though if it were me, I would still purchase a battery back-up, because most of them feature AVR (automatic voltage regulation), which levels out the power output without having to resort to using the battery's power supply. For example, if you have a high load being drawn on that circuit, or for some reason your voltage drops some (not too much of course), this unit (and some others) will compensate for that and give you a more constant amount of voltage. In my area, here in Florida it's pretty common to have outages, especially during storms and such. The most common outage is a very quick 1-2 second outage, and then the power will come back on. Which isn't great at all, it actually sucks, very much.I had JUST purchased my iMac and I was shopping around for Back-UPS units, when my house had a quick outage, and my brand new 27&#34; iMac did a hard shut down. Which gave me sort of a kick in the pants and coaxed me to purchase one VERY soon and ship it VERY fast. I was considering the APC Smart-UPS units, but they were outrageously expensive. Yes I realize that you pay for what you get, in some cases, but I just didn't want to spend $500-$600 on a battery back up. I absolutely needed a unit that provided Pure Sine Wave power when on battery power, because the newer iMacs all have PFC (Power Factor Corrected, I believe that's what the abbreviation stands for) Power Supply, and your average Back-UPS units like the APC models that you find at Staples, Office Depot and Wal-Mart absolutely will not work with computers that have these power supplies. This is because those Back-UPS units provide a &#34;Stepped Approximation to a Sine Wave&#34; when they are running on battery power&#34;, and newer computers, both Macs and PCs, with the PFC Power Supplies will NOT run them when it's running on battery power.I was debating on whether or not to purchase one of these CyberPower units, because I've seen a couple bad reviews on them, but a very large majority of the reviews were in fact very positive and the people had nothing but good words to write about these units. I think a majority of the issues come from the items being mishandled during the shipping process. I witnessed this when the customer service lady at UPS basically body slammed my Back-Ups unit onto the table right in front of me as I was picking up packages. They really don't care, because you could see what the item was, as it was shipped in the manufacturer's product packaging. Which is absolutely fine so long as someone doesn't use it to kick a field goal, as the manufacturers product packaging box is double walled cardboard, with a very generous amount of foam and extra cardboard spacing inside. Even with the super body slam, my unit worked absolutely wonderfully, no fan noise or anything.The build quality of these units isn't QUITE as great as the APC tower type units that you'll find at Staples and such, the outer skin on the CyberPower tower units is slightly thinner than the APC units, though it's still sturdy and not at all flexible or pliable. Everything else is absolutely wonderfully built. If you shake it there are no rattles, when you press on various body panels on it, none of them are loose or incorrectly fitted, receptacles are nice, and everything is great. Menu/interface functionality is great, easy to navigate and very intuitive. The buttons are solid when pressed also.One very large advantage that this unit has over it's non Pure Sine Wave APC counterparts that you'll find in stores is that these units are SMALL. Nice, small, and compact. I would say about half the size of those APC tower units. Making it possible to place it on your desk if you would like, next to your computer tower (if your computer has one) or somewhere else on the floor. It will not take up much room at ALL. It will maybe take up as much room as a single size 11 shoe will, that's it.The performance of this unit is great. I witnessed a couple times where the power dropped some and this unit properly compensated for it without having to kick over to battery power. There were quite a few times where household power was lost all together and this unit provided a perfect, instant, flawless transition to battery power and if it weren't for the click from the unit and the light sound of the fan kicking on, you wouldn't know it switched to battery power. Unless of course your computer notifies you when you are running on battery back-up, which my iMac did. I had my unit set on the highest sensitivity, and it was perfect. Sometimes with other units you will have an issue with the units being far too sensitive to have it on high sensitivity and really protect your computer and fast, and you will constantly hear the unit turning on and turning off, which was the case with the APC non-Sine Wave unit I purchased from Staples a couple years ago for another computer, and I had to leave that one set to medium sensitivity.The unit comes with software that you can use to set up automatic shut downs via different determinations such as the amount of time your computer is running on battery back up, how much charge the battery has left, and other parameters. THOUGH, and this is very important! With newer Macs, you absolutely do NOT need to install this provided software, or use any other kind of third part software. This is because you can go into System Preferences, and into Energy Saver, and once you have the Back-UPS unit connected to your Mac via the USB cable, your Energy Saver settings will automatically give you options to set up the Back-UPS unit and set up automatic proper shut downs by different parameters, like battery charge left, time running on battery and such. So these CyberPower units REALLY integrate very well with Macs, which is a very large plus.Bottom line is, if you are looking for a very nice Back-UPS unit for your computer that has a PFC Power Supply, and you don't want to spend $500 or more, then you really MUST look into this unit. It is absolutely amazing, and the price is amazingly ridiculously amazing (if that makes any sense, lol). CyberPower also has higher watt rated models, up to 2000VA I believe, my unit was a 1000VA, which is like 600w or such, and when it switched to battery power, it would give me a run time of 34 minutes, which is great, considering I was running quite a few programs and such at the time. So if you have a similar set up, you will have no problem getting adequate time to properly do everything you need with this model. If you have a much higher end gaming computer or such, I would possibly go with the 1350VA, 1600VA or 2000VA model. I am about to order a new Late-2012 27&#34; iMac (the new thin models) with the i7 Quad-Core / 3 TB HDD / 8 GB RAM (I'll be upgrading it to 32GB myself, which you can't do with the 21.5&#34; models, oddly enough) and 1 GB Video/Graphics, and for this one I plan on purchasing the 2000VA model, which will do me just fine.ALSO, ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT WARNING. If you have a laser printer, or anything else that has a very high current draw, DO NOT, I repeat do NOT plug the printer into the battery back-up provided side of the unit. Plug it into the Surge Protected Only side, or better yet, a completely separate surge protector strip, which is what I did. Because when you turn on the laser printer, or start printing, you will see the voltage drop on the display of you Back-UPS unit quite a bit.","12 11, 2012",Absolutely AMAZING value!

"These were an impulse buy for me... I have a pair of vintage Yamaha Orthodynamic headphones and also high-end openback Shures -- neither of which I wanted to use at the office for fear of losing them or breaking.As shallow as it sounds, I was drawn to their looks.  I was able to try them out at the store with my iPhone so it wasn't a completely blind leap of faith but still.They sound very good to me -- not overly bass heavy but full, detailed, and separated soundstage (my test for this is if I close my eyes, can I tell which side cellos are playing on -- yes!).They are ON-ear (as opposed to around ear) -- as a result, they are tend to clamp my ears and I have to take breaks from wearing them for awhile.  The picture on the box implies that you can flex and bend them every which way and they won't break.  I was hoping that this meant they didn't clamp your head as tight but so far, that doesn't seem to be the case :=-(FWIW, I haven't tried the bending and contorting the headphones to test their &#34;indistructability&#34; but I suspect there was some photo-shopping going on there!  They feel a bit to brittle to withstand that kind of stress.One thing that is nice is that the cord can be plugged into either side.  I like to have the cord on the left so that it doesn't get in the way of my mouse/trackball hand.I've been listening to everything from Bach and Brahms to Ray Charles, The Who, and Guns and Roses and these sound great for all genres.  They do block sound (my boss was accustomed to being able to yell out his office at me and now he has to come to my desk to get my attention... not a bad thing!).I did purchase the Aqua green color and was disappointed to see the white &#34;pleather&#34; ear cup -- I suspect that is going show dirt and grunge fairly quickly.  Oh well.Overall, I'm please with this set.

"When I bought my GX1, the included kit lens was thePanasonic 14-42mm. For as excited as I was about getting the GX1 (after lusting after the GF1 and GF2 for quite some time), I was pretty disappointed with the extremely light weight, plastic feel of the 14-42mm with its stiff zoom.I knew I wanted to get another lens for the camera, but I had to make a choice due to limited funds: ditch the 14-42mm and opt for the older but more robustPanasonic 14-45mmlens that used to be included with Panasonic's m4/3 kits, go all out for quality and low-light performance with thePanasonic 20mm f/1.7lens, or go for versatility with this 45-200mm lens.I'm glad I went with the choice I made by picking up this lens. Replacing my kit lens with the 14-45mm probably would have been the cheapest option once I sold off my 14-42mm kit lens, but I would have been left with pretty much the same available focal length and composition options. The 20mm would excel in low light, but it costs what this lens and the 14-42mm kit lens cost together, and I knew it wouldn't provide me the flexibility I'd want when shooting pictures of the kids out playing or at the zoo. Going with this 45-200mm, I cover an extremely wide range between two lenses for a very affordable price. While the 14-42mm isn't very quality feeling, having it is still better than having no wider angle lens option at all, and it still takes good pictures. The 45-200mm feels very high quality in comparison. A nice smooth zoom, a rubber zoom ring, and an optical image stabilization that works great.If you haven't used a telephoto lens before, you may be surprised by how heavy this little lens can start feeling once you've been holding it up in front of your face for a couple of minutes. It's not ungainly, but it's good to rest your arms often if you're shooting handheld to help keep camera shake to a minimum. This lens makes me want to pick up thePanasonic DMW-LVF2 External Live View Finderfor both easier composition when trying to snap pictures of a moving target at the longer focal lengths, and for extra stabilization during shooting thanks to being able to brace the camera against your face instead of having to hold it far enough away to frame the picture via the rear LCD screen.If you have any of the micro four-thirds cameras from Panasonic or Olympus and have been shooting with just your kit lens up until this point, I would highly recommend you pick this up as your first add-on lens purchase. You'll be impressed with the clarity, color reproduction, and sharpness of this lens, and the versatility in composition this lens will bring to your kit is the best available zoom-range-to-dollar option I've seen in the Panasonic and Olympus m4/3 lens offerings.","05 24, 2013",First add-on lens for my GX1 kit; glad I picked it up.,1369353600,Electronics
"I bought this camera to replace an IP video camera, in order to be able to watch for expected visitors without being tied to the front window, allowing me to get other things done while waiting.  It works very well for that purpose.  In fact it is considerably better than the IP video camera purpose-built for that. This camera is particularly good for that that because it is small and unobtrusive, it can auto-focus and auto-adjust for the light conditions, and be remotely zoomed if desired.  Because it is battery-powered, I didn't expect it to have much WiFi range, and it doesn't, but it is good enough be to useful for me.  Working by remote control from my Android phone or tablet, the battery lasts for a couple hours. For more time, I also purchased a DMW-DCC10/DMW-AC5 AC adapter, which works well.The camera also takes good still pictures, and because of its small, easily pocketable size, it has been very useful to take along when I go out just in case an unexpected photo opportunity arises.  The SZ5 doesn't have a mode dial or touch screen, but none-the-less, is quite useable.For improvements, I'd like to see the WiFi remote control range increased.  Perhaps that could be done by also allowing a remote control mode that works through an existing WiFi channel.The WiFi remote control experiment Panasonic tried with this camera is very successful.

"The world became an infinitesimally better place with the release, finally, of these six albums produced between 1962 and 1964 by Phil Spector, and accompanied in this beautifully presented box set by a seventh new compilation.Due to past neglect of the Philles label catalogue all six albums are appearing on CD for the first time, all remastered in their original mono. They are presented as mini facsimiles of the original album releases in thick cardboard sleeves (with paper liners) that are slightly larger than the standard 5"" CD size to better enjoy the original artwork. A 36-page booklet includes an informative essay by Mick Patrick as well as full track list details. At present these albums are only available in the box set, and although modestly priced, I would hope that they become available separately eventually.The six albums comprise the first five to be released on the Philles and the seventh. The omitted sixth album is the legendary Christmas album, which has long been available on CD before and is easily obtainable elsewhere.Phil Spector was primarily a producer of singles and did not extend the same production values or care to his early albums. Bob B Soxx and the Blue Jeans' album largely runs out of steam after the singles that comprise the first two tracks and limps home with an instrumental on which none of the group even appear. Bob B Soxx (aka Bobby Sheen) is replaced by Darlene Love as lead singer on over half the tracks. She was Spector's secret weapon and also led two of the Crystals' biggest singles.  Of the three albums the Crystals made for Phil Spector, all would probably all fit onto one CD because the second album, He's A Rebel, was a disguised re-issue of the first, Uptown Twist, but with three new tracks replacing two from the first, whilst the third, The Crystals Sing The Greatest Hits, Volume 1, recycled some of their hits yet again, but added five new covers of recent dance hits, most of them sung by Veronica from the Ronettes. Four Crystals' tracks (Uptown, Oh Yeah Maybe Baby, There's No Other and on Broadway) appear three times each throughout this box set. Today's Hits has just five tracks not included elsewhere in the box, these being four Darlene Love singles (Playing For Keeps is a B-side new to CD, and very welcome) and the third Bob B Soxx single, Not Too Young To Get Married (also led by Darlene).By the end of 1963 Phil Spector had become more ambitious and began preparing albums on which every track could be a single. The first of these was the aforementioned A Christmas Gift For You, and then in November 1964 came Presenting The Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica. This, one of the greatest albums ever made, included all their singles to date, and three B-sides, released before and after the album. So Young, the old song by the Students, had also been released as a single by Veronica. Spector would clearly have liked to make Veronica a solo performer, but they and their family were resolved they stay as a trio. However, Spector later claimed that neither Estelle or Nedra ever sang a note on a Ronettes record. He was renowned for using session singers such as the Blossoms, Bobby Sheen and Ch&eacute;r to augment the Crystals, the Ronettes and others to create his wall of sound. Famously, none of the Crystals sang on He's A Rebel and had to learn the song after it had been released in order to perform it live.Of the purely album tracks I Wonder was to be a single by the Crystals (in the UK only), who recorded it a couple of months after the Ronettes; and Chapel Of Love by the Dixie Cups (after both songs' writers, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, had jumped ship to the Red Bird label). I Wonder was revived a year later on Red Bird by a group called the Butterflys, whose line-up included two former Crystals. When I Saw You, a slow ballad written by Phil Spector, was allegedly inspired by Veronica (later Ronnie Spector). It was, in an earlier version, the first song he recorded with the Ronettes; whilst the Ray Charles classic What'd I Say replicated the Ronettes' exciting stage act, complete with toppy microphones and live audience responses (though it was all concocted in the Gold Star studios). Ten of these album tracks were on The Best of The Ronettes CD compilation, and eight in the Back To Mono box set, but this is the first time the original album has been available on CD. In 1975 Spector released a vinyl stereo mix of the album in the UK under the title The Ronettes Sing Their Greatest Hits, and these were all included on a German Ronettes CD compilation called All The Hits, on the Charly subsidiary label Classic Hits.The 'bonus' CD is a new compilation that gathers 17 largely instrumental B-sides. Spector liked to put out studio jams of no commercial value on the flipsides of singles, to ensure concentrated airplay on the top-sides. These were played by the crack team of sessioneers that comprised the Wrecking Crew. Some of these held a nostalgic appeal for me as I bought many of those singles on the London label in the UK and turned the records over countless times. Not an obvious choice for a CD release, I am delighted these have seen the light of day.Still uncollected are the remaining five Philles albums: three Righteous Brothers albums, a Lenny Bruce album and Ike and Tina Turner's River Deep - Mountain High album (already commercially available). A lot of additional material became available in the seventies on the Warner-Spector label in America and even more on Phil Spector International in the UK, collected as a nine-album vinyl box set called Wall Of Sound. One can only hope that this material might also now one day become available on CD.","11 18, 2011",Adding To The Sum Of Human Happiness,1321574400,CDVinyl

"Unlike one of the reviewers who brutally attacked the film as being shallow and boring, I found it very interesting and full of facts that many people are not aware of concerning the life of anyone in the monarchy of England.  It isn't that I find that having a monarchy a necessary thing, however, that said, there are many things that the rest of the population isn't aware of that go on in the life of anyone who happens to be born into that life.  It isn't all glamor and luxury, as it appears from the outside, these people often live very unhappy lives, because they are loyal to the duties that are placed upon them from birth.  No, I am not from England, I just am very empathetic with anyone in a position of power and what the responsibility entails, especially when as in England, the position isn't always sought after, as was the case with King Edward VI.  And no, the things that he speaks of during his childhood, that clearly caused his stammering, are NOT  irrelevant.  they illustrate my very point.  Like the monarchy or anything about it or not, you can at least take from the film, an example of what any ordinary person may go through who has had similar problems growing up.  I personally know someone who has a speech impediment caused by child abuse.  It has affected him his entire life.  But back to the film, I found Colin Firth to be very effective in his roll as the speech therapist.  He was likable and believable and an interesting personality.  I found Geoffrey Rush to be a very compelling character.  I liked him very much and he was entirely believable in his personality and his interaction with the speech therapist.  Not too touchy feely, as hollywood likes to get with these kind of parts.  That would have been entirely unbelievable in this setting.  Helena Bonham Carter was also good in her roll as the kings wife.  It illustrates that not all in the royal circle are stuffy and stiff.The film is a true story, which I especially like to watch, in this day of make believe and so much fluff and no substance or anything of any value to say at all.  This story, outlines a very important time in world history, the dawning of WWII.  It does this very briefly, but never the less, it adds to the weight of the entire story, of a man thrust into the roll of King, in a country who played a crucial roll in whipping the Nazis ass.  No this fact is not part of the film, it is just something you think about after seeing the end of the story.All in all, I found the story, the people and the way it was put together, to be of excellent quality.

"A war is waging in the streets of Los Angeles between two rival gangs. Lieutenant Mike Harrigan of the LAPD is caught right in the middle, but he and his team are about to receive help from the most unlikely of allies: an alien Predator that has chosen LA as his new hunting ground! Conceptually, PREDATOR 2 is the perfect sequel. It does not attempt to recreate the first film, but rather moves the setting to the next logical location: The concrete jungles of LA. The Thomas Brothers turn in another action-packed script that attempts to outdo the original at every turn. There is more blood, more violence, and more gadgets as this sleek new urban Predator sets out to collect his human trophies using metal shurikens, razorwire nets, and spears. The redesigned costume and differing attack patterns show us that the Predator race is as varied and diverse as our own, which leads up to a shocking finale aboard the Predator spacecraft. Danny Glover offers a welcomed change of pace from Arnold and the gang, playing a breakneck cop with no regard for authority. For all of the awesome action sequences and gory murders, however, the story itself is often contrived, and conveniently places the Predator in all the right places at all the right times. PREDATOR 2 comes as close as any sequel could to reproducing the thrills and non-stop action of the original, while giving us something new entirely.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies","01 31, 2013",Predator 2,1359590400,MovieTV
"How about a quick review on the product, rather than the cost, wouldn't that be refreshing?As the title states, Law & Order is a fantastic series.  I was unhappy to hear that it had finally been cancelled, but once word got out that this box set would be released before Christmas, it lessened the pain a bit.

Spanish subtitles are available on seasons one - eight & fourteen, seasons previously released.  French subtitles are found on a few of these as well.What I found surprising, & rather disappointing, is that the only Special Features/Extras in the entire 20 seasons are found in the previously released seasons.

"The late John Hughes' classic film about Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a mischievous teen, and his day off of school.  Teenager Ferris plays sick to get out of school and drags his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck - who really is sick and legitimately out of school) along for the fun.  A hilarious film about teenage angst and mischief.  That said let me point out Ive adored ALL things Broderick since I first saw him so definitely probably one or two stars just for that reason alone.  The film does not hold the power its did when I was younger for me.  Some of it's corny and ridiculous and part concerns me it may give the wrong idea to kids -- only a small part though.  I tend to give kids more credit for intelligence than most adults -- who can now legally fuss up their lives and too often do.  We expect teens to go from child to adulthood like the flipping of a switch 'cause 18 is a magic number apparently but so many treat their teens like kids it's no wonder many cry, shack their fists and bemoan &#34;what happened?&#34; when trouble finds their young adults.  This is subtitled in English for the deaf and I believe all of the special features are too (YIPPEE THANKY!!) but not 100% sure they all are now.  The odd think is there is no trailer on this special edition set.  So strange.  Anyhow being a long time John Hughes fan this is a must for all Hughes collectors.

"It's clear that most reviews are written by enthusiasts: that's why most product reviews are so high. Naturally, there is also the odd reviewer who really hates a book or movie and is determined to have his opinion heard. However, the vast, silent majority are mostly indifferent to almost everything. In any case, the point of this rather abstract introduction is that I fall into none of these three categories: I'm a movie lover who was disappointed by this ""classic"" of the forties. I had seen it before, but many years ago when I was a kid.I admit that for its time it was ground-breaking. Hollywood didn't usually treat of alcoholism in any serious way and here we get benders, DTs, alcoholic hospitals, moral degradation and a lot more. Yet somehow--and I suppose we should expect this--the movie never quite loses its Hollywood sheen. Ray Milland is good enough in the leading role, but given Hollywood's propensity for gifting the acting oscar to anyone who is given an overacting opportunity, the oscar award doesn't say a lot. Everyone does a competent job, but the real problem is in the screenplay. Milland is an alcoholic who has never had a job, but wants to become a writer. It is assumed from the beginning that somewhere deep inside Birnam there is a real and talented writer struggling to emerge: but what is the proof? A few student articles and an early piece in Reader's Digest. Other than that, there is zilch. Lots of people want to write--but unless you write you're not a writer. Perhaps it would have been unendurable at the time to admit that most alcoholics don't have any special skill waiting to emerge: they are simply alcoholics. The Hollywood schmaltz element is further highlighted when Jane Wyman, a worker on Time magazine and the possessor of a perfect Hollywood wardrobe, decides to fall in love with our alcoholic nobody who--for reasons of Hollywood etiquette--must have the makings of a 'somebody'inside him. This might actually have done harm to the real alcoholics' cause, as one of the worst aspects of the disease is that the sufferer becomes a social pariah: the idea of an unemployed alcoholic winning the love of a high class lady from Time magazine and keeping it through all his degradations is pure Hollywood hoo-ha. Even the end of the movie rings false with Milland giving up drink and beginning on his infamous novel, ""The Bottle"", once again. This is supposed to be a happy ending--but the odds are that its just one more false dawn before the drinking starts again.I'm sorry to be so negative, but this movie after deciding to deal with an important issue of this kind refuses to face the real horrors head on and, instead, is determined to wrap them up in several layers of Hollywood hokum.","09 17, 2011","Worthy, but outdated",1316217600,MovieTV

You can look up that laptop if you want to know the specs.  My Acer has played the game flawlessly so far, no problems at all.I am about half way thru the game at this point and I am really enjoying it.  The graphics are beautiful as many reviewers have mentioned, although the storyline is a bit weird and hard to follow sometimes.  I agree with some people who have said some aspects of the game don't make a lot of sense, but that didn't bother me too much.I suggest the XBOX controller for the PC game, it worked much better for me than the keyboard or LogiTech controler, which I just thought was cheap and light feeling, plus the configuration of the XBOX controler worked better for me.  It's worth the extra cost IMHO.Also, the game is very hard at some places, so much so you may want to give up.

I believe this was the first album to also include Danny Kirwin who is certainly an iatrical part of the musical mix here.  Yes, some of the material here sounds quite dated (especially the more ballad oriented stuff), but much of it holds up really well too.  Of course the album contains one of the all time classic guitar riffs of the 60's with ""Oh Well"", and the classic blues romp ""Rattlesnake Shake"" can be found here as well.  If it is jamming you want, it does not get much better than the ""Searching For Madge / ""Fighting For Madge"" section of the album.

"This is definitely one of the hardest games I've had to review. I'm rating it from two different perspectives. My perspective is that this is a 3/5 star game. But, for kids, this is easily a 5/5 star game. I'm averaging this out to 4/5 stars, though I definitely feel the game should otherwise be a 3/5 star from my perspective.From my view: The game is repetitive. The levels are beautiful, but I don't really remember many of them specifically. The music is great at times, but overly simple other times. The lava theme, specifically, is amazing. I really liked certain areas where the gameplay changed and it controls very very well. But, it just wasn't fun sometimes. It was clearly under challenging. I think this could easily have been solved if they had simply included a normal mode or hard mode vs the easy mode that I was playing. I don't normally think games are too easy. I'm perfectly happy with playing most games on normal, heck, even occasionally on easy. But this game was too easy, to the point of boredom.From what I imagine to be a view for children: squeaky voices, amazingly well done visuals, great design, simple puzzles, rewarding reasons to go back into levels, and customizable house. What more could you want? Even if you aren't a great gamer, you can get an adult or better gamer friend to play with you in the 2-player mode. I can imagine, if I were younger, that this would be the game I would play non-stop. I can honestly say, I wish I had this game when I was really young, it would have been nice to have a game this easy instead of the frustrating old-school Nintendo games.If you're a more abled gamer with friends, I'd recommend Little Big Planet 2, my favorite platforming (and more) game currently.","02 28, 2012",The toughest game to review,1330387200,VideoGames

"I'm not confident that these are the stable and long lasting in-organic dye discs that I expected.  Per ImgBurn the batch I received 05/05/2014 are MID: CMCMAG-BA3-000 with Recorded Mark Polarity: HTL.  However, there's a definite purple hue to the dye side.  To me, that suggests ""organic"" dye.  HTL write strategy suggests ""inorganic"" but the purple color suggests ""organic.""I am trying to keep away from the organic dyes with their propensity to degrade.  I've switched to BD-R largely because the inorganic dye discs are available in that format at a good price.  (For DVD, the only write-once inorganic discs are M-Disc as far as I know and per gigabyte, M-Discs cost more than BD-R 25GB discs. [CDRW, DVD-RAM, and DVDRW are also inorganic.])  So, CMC Magnetics is difficult to avoid these days.  CMC doesn't automatically mean ""bad"" any more.  And, HTL is something I truly desire if that indicates that the disc is inorganic.  However, this purple color bothers me.  I think I'm going to play it safe and send them back before I try burning some.  All other ""inorganic"" HTL discs I've seen have a dye side that is a gray or purely silver color.  Even some BD-R HTL discs with CMC MID codes are on the market with that gray dye.  But this batch being purple?  I don't know that I feel confident here.  I'll wait a few days before returning this batch just to see if any of you nice folks can allay my fears.I bought this batch because of the marketing hyperbole at the tdkperformance-dot-com site where the ""inorganic"" dye is touted as their mainstay and where the TDK MID code is described as a prominent identifier.  However, I guess TDK has chosen to ""farm out"" production to CMC without changing their marketing hype because the discs I received did not have a TDK MID code--they have a CMC MID code.  This isn't unusual.  It's misleading, but, it's not unusual.  I know of two other media brand names that have done the same ""bait and switch.""  I don't think it's fair but we can't always know what's in the box until we buy it and open it.  That's the reason I stick with Amazon--good return policy that protects us from these deceptive marketing ploys.UPDATE:  I now see that there is another term floating about.  That term new to me is ""composite.""  I saw an article talking about 3 types of BD-R dye.  I only knew of two up until I read that article.  The article describes the 3 types of dye as:  (1) Inorganic phase change type, (2) Organic (Azo) type, and (3) Composite.  I don't know what ""composite"" means but it sounds to me like it could be a mix of phase change alloy along with organic Azo mixed in.  If my supposition is correct, that means the composite dye could be burned using HTL but it has quickly degrading Azo mixed in to make it cheaper.  Also if that's true, it would mean that a report of HTL polarity for a disc is not a reliable indicator of its dye type.If ""composite"" is a mix of two dyes, that would give it a ""metallic purple"" color.  But, of course, that would also mean it's tainted with organic dye and therefore not as durable as purely inorganic dye.I have a need for both types of dye for different types of tasks.  There's some discs I would like to burn cheaply and I don't care how long they last once they've performed over the short haul.  But, there are some things important to me and I want to preserve them with the greatest chance for survival.  However, I absolutely need to know what it is that I'm buying.  I must be the one who can make the choice.  I don't want to find a precious archive unreadable because a manufacturer tried to hide the contents of the dye from me.","05 5, 2014",Dye looks purple.

"This is an interesting solution to creating a minimal cover and stand for the Note 12.2.  It successfully enables multiple landscape support without too many layers of product.  Unfortunately, in creating this minimal solution, the designers have also minimized the retention of the tablet in the cover.  Four leather-look prongs are expected to securely hold the tablet by two corners and two mid-points.  Three other prongs are used occasionally for support or for closure.  I didn't like the fact that closure of this case required the tablet edges to repeatedly be subjected to abrasions by these &#34;padded&#34; prongs.

"I bought this model, seeking specifically for the combination of screen size and built-in DVD player, and I'm highly satisfied. It's not perfect, but what is? It could be closer to perfect, however, if Toshiba addressed some minor nits.1. It reverts to a default 4:3 aspect ratio whenever you turn it on, never mind that you've previously chosen a different aspect ratio. Annoying.2. As others have mentioned there's not much audio power, but for my purposes it's not a deal-breaker. It sits on my desk so I don't need it to play loud.3. There is no headphone jack, but... ditto.4. Front panel controls would be nice. Perhaps placed on the base or very skinny buttons placed on the bottom edge of the bezel. Aesthetics dictated the decision to place them on the side, probably, but I wish some TV manufacturer would decide that Function should be placed ahead of Form.5. The TV is smart enough to power up in DVD mode if you press Play on the remote, but it is dumb enough to power up in tuner mode if you press the power button, never mind that the unit was previously turned off in DVD mode.I bought a refurbished model from Amazon and the only flaw I've noticed is a subtle fingerprint on the screen that refuses to come off, though I don't want to scrub too hard.

"I bought this case from Accessory Genie on Amazon. They delivered the case ahead of the originally promised delivery date.The case makes the phone very comfortable to hold. Before I installed the case, I was always almost-dropping the phone because it is so light and slippery. Now the phone feels very natural in my hand - the case is soft enough to keep in my hand for extended periods. I also really like the portable kickstand, which can be used to prop up the phone in Landscape as well as Portrait mode.  And all this comfort and convenience for less than 10 dollars, how can you beat that?EDIT 1/13/2013:Last week I bought the 4200mA extended battery from Hyperion with the Pebble Blue cover here on Amazon.The new double-size battery is amazing, letting me use the phone over 24 hours straight without Power Saving Mode turned on, even with new Jelly Bean update.I am very happy to report that I was able to continue to use this cover, with the following details:1. Take this case off your phone (silicone and plastic over-covers, front and back)2. Install the new Hyperion battery and new Hyperion back cover3. Hold the front half of the plastic over-cover in your hand, face down4. Lay the phone into the plastic over-cover, face down5. Stretch the silicone over the assembly, gently, so it does not come apart in your handThat is it my friends.  The silicone stretches ever-so-slightly and firmly captures the ribs in the front over-cover, holding it all together nicely. The holes and buttons in the silicone all still line up perfectly, since they are registered to the front half of the plastic over-case.  It feels very much like it did before, and slides in and out of my pockets about the same as before.  Of course it is slightly heavier, but that is not a big deal because this phone is very light.  (Hard to describe this to people who have not held this phone themselves - how can such a large handset be this light weight?)The only drawback is that the kickstand is missing in action.

"Like so many viewers, time travel fascinates me &#8230; so I&#8217;m naturally drawn to science fiction films that explore similar themes.  There have been many, many great ones over the years; and &#8211; to be honest &#8211; even the average space age thriller can achieve more than a few nice moments in exploring man&#8217;s attempt to either alter the past or salvage the future.  One of my personal favorite time travel films remains Nicholas Meyer&#8217;s TIME AFTER TIME (1979), and what&#8217;s genius about it to me even after all of this time is the balance that script managed between its modest sci-fi elements and believable, interesting characters.  See &#8211; and this is the tipping point for every film &#8211; if we like the characters, then we&#8217;re liable to give the flick an honest pass on taking the affordable way out &#8230; and that&#8217;s possibly what might save 95ERS: TIME RUNNERS from its own extermination.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)A few decades beyond today, mankind teeters on extinction from waging wars that have left our planet largely destroyed.  Our last best hope lies in the hands of those who&#8217;ve been trained to use time machines in order to change the past in order to revise our future.  But the work of present-day (and pregnant!) FBI agent Sally Biggs (played with middling conviction at best by Alesandra Durham) is interfering with these future warriors attempts to &#8216;right&#8217; the timeline.  She&#8217;s using the resources of the federal government to probe the mysterious death of her physicist husband.  Could it be that she&#8217;s inadvertently tapped into an alternate reality that&#8217;s causing mankind&#8217;s demise &#8230; or is this just part and parcel of being pregnant?I kid.  Seriously, I kid.  But that&#8217;s the problem I tend to have with independent features that take themselves vastly too seriously, and you can certainly chalk 95ERS into that category.  All of it is approached with a level of seriousness not necessarily simpatico with the nature of the production &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a low budget sci-fi thriller, so embrace it, people.Written and directed by Thomas Gomez Durham (I&#8217;m guessing this might be nepotism, too!), 95ERS tries to do a whole lot of things on a budget built for a summer tent-pole feature but without any of the frills.  For example, not only is Sally Biggs an FBI Agent, but she&#8217;s also pregnant &#8230; and, not only is she pregnant, but her physicist/husband disappeared under curious circumstances &#8230; and not only did her physicist/husband disappear under curious circumstances but also he (and she) may be directed tied into these time wars of the future &#8230; and not only might the two of them be tied into these time wars of the future but also their unborn son might also be tied into it as well.Oh, yeah, and did I mention Sally has the ability to manipulate time in the present?It&#8217;s overkill &#8211; never a good thing &#8211; and it&#8217;s the kind of overkill one might expect, say, if you were casting some big budget actress (Angelina Jolie or a Julia Roberts or even a Meryl Streep) &#8230; only they probably wouldn&#8217;t be drawn to the material.  Essentially, Ms. Biggs is a modern day mutant, only this isn&#8217;t going to be a story told with the stylish presentation befitting a modern day mutant; this will be done &#8216;on the cheap.&#8217;  That, and the story told won&#8217;t quite tie itself up with the same ease and grace normally befitting those silver screen tales based on comic books, so the mission and the narration all feels more than a bit muddled.  In fact, I have to admit that I&#8217;m not all that convinced all of this tied up the way one might expect a time travel yarn to do; suffice it to say it ends with a bit of a promise for more &#8230; but would anyone show up?Maybe if their surname was Durham.  This was clearly a family affair &#8211; not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with it &#8211; but, at some point, maybe an outside voice would&#8217;ve been helpful if for no other reason than to point out the film lacked any organic flow to it.95ERS: TIME RUNNERS is produced by Space Ace Media.  DVD distribution is being handled by Inception Media Group.  As for the technical specifications, this is an independent feature that serves up some quality sights and sounds, though I&#8217;ll point out that the mike work left a bit to be desired in a few sequences.  Also &#8211; as tends to happen when these small releases require some high quality CGI effects sequences &#8211; there&#8217;s a noticeable difference between the visual qualities between stuff shot with human characters versus the high-tech computer-generated spacecraft; it&#8217;s occasionally jarring but not all that of a distraction.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you&#8217;ve a bit in store: there&#8217;s an audio commentary from the director and his star (both with last names Durham) along with some additional scenes.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  As a low budget thrillers, 95ERS: TIME RUNNERS is far from perfect.  As an indie science fiction feature, it may squeeze a bit closer to comfortable territory, but I&#8217;m once more inclined to chalk this up as yet one more example of what happens when relative newcomers write and direct their own work &#8211; unfortunately, they&#8217;re simply too close to the material to detect the weaknesses inherent in the script as well as the execution.  I&#8217;ve no doubt when &#8211; twenty years from now &#8211; someone decides to pick this up and remake it it&#8217;ll likely end up being a more balanced picture, but this one has plenty of narrative flaws.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Inception Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of 95ERS: TIME RUNNERS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review, and it in no way, shape, or form influenced this opinion of it.","04 8, 2014",Muddled 95ERS A Time-Travel Yarn With Too Much (Family) Thread,1396915200,MovieTV
"I agree with the Reverend's five star review except for his praise concerning the tempi. They are undeniably slow, but Kempe conducts with conviction, reverence, and power. The performance possesses beauty as well as gravity.  The St.Hedwigs Cathedral choir is large and sweet, the BPO is a major asset, and the soloists are mostly unsurpassed. Elisabeth Grummer was a great Mozartean-Donna Anna for Furtwangler and Mitropoulos-as well as a memorable Gabriel in Karl Forster's Berlin Creation and Kempe's Brahms German Requiem. She possessed a large, glowing voice, and couldsing rapturously when it was necessary. She was also a great lieder singer, with a fine Schubert/Brahms disc.  Noone has outsung her in the Requiem, I think.  This is a large claim when one considers the competition that I have heard, including EdithMathis, Margaret Price, Maria Stader, Helen Donath, Teresa Stich-Randall, Lucia Popp et al. Stader for Karl Richter and Popp for Krips come closest I think.  Helmut Krebsis my favorite Bach tenor, with a relatively small tone which was quite penetrating and extremely accurate. GottlobFrick was caught at the apex of his black bass power. Try his ""Tuba Mirum"" here. Marga Hoffgen was a fine oratoriosinger whose timbre never attracted me-she is fine in this Requiem.Peers: Richter/Teldec (my favorite), Bohm/Philips (not DG), Davis/Philips, Krips/Andante, Jochum/DG","05 24, 2013","Some slow tempi mostly redeemed by soloists, orchestra snd chorus",1369353600,CDVinyl

"There are preciously few bad Depp films (save the hokey Pirates of the Caribbean sequels) and The Rum Diary is no exception - it's another neat little romp with Depp's offbeat trademark.Johnny Depp gets into quirky roles better than most actors, and in this, he plays an idealistic journalist in Puerto Rico.  In this brave new world, Depp's character Paul Kemp has to navigate Cold War and US imperialist tendencies of the time while maintaining his sense of moral integrity.The Rum Diary is enjoyable because you can feel the passion everyone had in making the film.  Set in the 1960s, it has an otherworldly, nostalgic setting that's rare in today's cinema.  It feels like a tribute in some ways to world cinema of that era and the good ol' days of being American.  It's like watching a Graham Greene or Hemingway-esque novel spiked with rum.  I think the people who don't enjoy it just don't get what the film is supposed to be about - and it's hardly complicated.Rum Diary also has shades of a Coen Brothers film but is far more down to earth.  The cast is brilliant - Aaron Eckhart; Amber Heard (you can practically see Depp falling in love with her onscreen); the seedy Giovanni Ribisi and the hapless Michael Rispoli - all make for an interesting and enjoyable lot of misfits.","11 10, 2012",The Underrated Deppman,1352505600,MovieTV

That indiscretion will embroil her family in a worldwide pandemic when she brings a plague home with her.  It spreads from her to her son and from there to the world.  Matt Damon plays her long-suffering husband Mitch, trying to protect his daughter as the world falls apart.That human story tries to anchor the global events as the virus spirals out of control.  Governments are at first too slow to recognize the threat and then too slow to respond as the contagion outpaces laws, politics, and civility.  It's not long before looting, murder, and mass outages wrack all the major population centers.Throughout the film we follow the stories of individual scientists doing their level best to stem the insidious tide.  Some will rise to the occasion, others selfishly protect their loved ones, and still others simply die trying. Paralleling the plague of the body is the plague of the mind, embodied by Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) as a popular countercultural blogger proposing fictional cures , and his actions prove that disinformation can be more deadly than the virus itself.Despite the personal stories of the scientists and Emhoff, ""Contagion"" is oddly bloodless.  The interspersed newscasts never quite bring home the visceral horror of a world gone mad.  There's so much time hopping between geographies that we never stay anchored with one story long enough to really care about the characters.Still, ""Contagion"" makes up for its lack of narrative with Steven Soderbergh's excellent cinematography. The bare, haunting score accentuates the camera's lingering moments on hands and surfaces where the invisible virus lurks.  Every sniffle, every handshake, takes on a new grim significance.  By the end of the film we get to see what happened in Day 1, but by then we already know what's coming.""Contagion"" is as much as a public service announcement as it is an entertaining film.  The fact that it manages to be both is still an achievement.  And remember kids, always sneeze into your elbow, always wash your hands, and never sleep with strangers.","10 4, 2012",A public service announcement,1349308800,MovieTV
"I had very low expectations when I first started watching Grimm.  However, because the premise was different (I am so sick of the cookie cutter prime time series that is all that's offered by the ABC, NBC and CBS), I decided to give it a try.Basically, the series is about a &#34;Grimm&#34;; a Detective who was raised by an Aunt, and who inherited the ability to see the creatures from childhood fairy tales (more like nightmares).  We find out that the stories were all based on truths, and it is the Grimm who keeps the creatures from ruling over the human race.  A little far fetched, but very imaginative.I'd recommend this series to anyone who wanted an X-Files/True Blood (without the sex scenes) series.  It does it's job, as far as keeping you entertained for an hour (and that's all I ask for my prime time shows).","05 25, 2013",Great dark fantasy series,1369440000,MovieTV
"I do agree with a two star reviewer, that Ziva seems to be the best agent NCIS has ever had. When she first came in season three, she didn't know squat about procedure. Or the American way, I do agree it became annoying, to end season 6, with her disobeying Gibbs twice. And Lieing to him several times, as well as the other members of the team. Dinnozzo, has reverted his season one self. I would have thought that after Jenny's death, and before that, having to blow his cover. That he would be more mature, buuut no. And Mcgee, I've kind of grown to hate him. They gave him a spine in an episode called ""Caged"", ever since then. He's become mean, annoying and his relationship with Dinozzo has become a one upmanship on insults. And it carried on into season 7, Now season seven opens with one of the best episodes I've ever seen out of NCIS. Mcgee and Dinozzo going after Ziva, with Gibbs sniping the bad guy. And all is well once again in the world of NCIS, but wait, Massad didn't rescue Ziva. NCIS did, and they want her back. But Gibbs won't let her go, because he trusts her no matter what. Even after he finds out that she killed Ari, on orders from her father to gain the trust of Gibbs, but here she's suddenly changed. And wants to be and NCIS agent, and an American citizen as well. Annnnnnnd once again, WE GET GIBB'S PAST BROUGHT UP AGAIN!!!!, now we all know what he did. He took matters into his own hands, and killed a mexican drug lord. And this story nearly takes up all of season 7, even the ending to this season just ends. I get it, Gibbs killed the guy cause he killed his wife and daughter. Lets move on, and Ducky. Shoot Palmer makes more appearances than Ducky does, I have to agree once again, They ruined Dinozzo, and made Ziva the poster child behind Gibbs. Mcgee gets turned into an agent who is mean, and tries to compete with Tony over who can insult the other the worst.

"OK, so 5 stars says &#34;This thing is great, wonderful and...&#34; but for me, it is.Yes, if it weren't for other reviewers here at AMAZON I might not be so enthusiastic (more on that later), but after using it for a few days, I am actually ordering another one for my Win 8 touchscreen laptop. Looks like a snap to transport as it is almost flat not think at all.I had been using a Microsoft Trackball Explorer since they were announced, loved it from the first use and wore out several over the years. I even bought a couple extra when I heard they were being discontinued. Alas, they too have worn out and become a little problematic. Some failed because the supports for the trackball no longer separated the ball from the &#34;cavity&#34; (really common and repairable for the Tim Allens among us), others had scroll wheel or button issues. They are all sitting here waiting for my inner Tim Allen. to come out and fix them....You can still pay &#34;stupid&#34; money for a new one someone is selling (l saw one for $650!), or slightly off-kilter money for a &#34;rebuilt&#34; used one (about twice or three times the original new price), but I understand that is a stopgap measure. Adapt or perish I say, so forward into the mist I go!I tried a different brand &#34;scrolling trackball&#34; that you operated the cursor with your fingers, not your thumb. It is usable but not nearly what I was used to. One day, using my laptop and the trackpad it had in it, it occurred to me that I had adapted to the trackpad there pretty well, so maybe something like that for the desktop would work. After reading reviews and &#34;looking at&#34; the three different offerings I could find (Dell, Lenovo and Logitech) online, I bought a Logitech T650 wireless Touchpad from dear old Amazon. If it didn't work well I wanted the customer service of Amazon there to help me!I was not sure how it would work for me, and I had to learn the proper way to scroll (it seems the opposite of a wheel somehow, but it's exactly like a touchscreen), and to keep my hand positioned &#34;over it&#34; and not always tap the pad in the bottom area. Now I am feeling comfortable with it, I could not figure out how to select text though and it was making me question the decision. Sometimes the click and hold I was trying worked but many times it didn't. That's when a review here revealed that the rubber feet on the bottom two corners were actually &#34;push button&#34; switches (and that feeling of a switch I had experienced a couple of times wasn't my imagination). A light went on in my head and now the select, copy drag and the context menu functions all work terrific. I just needed to know what was needed. While you can tap in the main area for a single click, it appears that the bottom corners are for the right click and click and hold. And there is a mechanical switch that you can feel there! Use your thumb to depress it (or your pinkie finger for a right click) and if dragging or selecting, swipe you index finger across the surface! Anyone can do it if they aspire to!Now I am a happy camper! I would have given the review a credit here but I can't locate his review. I did give him the +1 treatment at the review when I read it, and several other reviewers have discovered this feature and posted about it, but his review made me flip the touchpad over and click the rubber pad to see it happen. Sometimes it takes that for me to grasp things.....I noticed many reviews decried the effort required to use this device, and I understand that. It is new, different and not as easy to go to as the mouse or trackball design you've used for a long time. And not understanding how it worked, or more precisely, thinking incorrectly about how it worked, made common functions a chore. I kept the &#34;other&#34; trackball here and plugged in (you can do that) as a security blanket, but I seldom go for it after a couple weeks of adapting to the touchpad. AND after learning the secret of the feet!","07 8, 2014","The secret to understanding how to operate this unit is in the feet! No, really!",1404777600,Electronics

It has much more of that late 60's style and you can almost hear Judy Blue Eyes Suite in some passages.  Just because someone does harmonies, does not automatically make them Beach Boy imitators.  I enjoyed all the tracks on this album.  My only complaint would be that they do get a little heavy on the reverb with the vocals.  Every song has that ""sung in a cavern"" sound except for one (Blue Spotted Tail) where the vocal is up front and very good.

"It is a very cost effective way to add some &#34;smart&#34; TV capabilities to your existing television, as long as it has a free HDMI port, but it is not without its flaws. Video playback is excellent, and running Android 4.1, you can use almost any app from Google play or Amazon app store, although you will have to download Amazon app store, perfect for those that already have an Android 4.1 based phone or tablet. The default text font is large, so browsing on a TV, like my 42&#34; panasonic from a bedroom or living room sitting distance is no problem. It uses very little power, I leave mine on constantly with no issues, it gets warm to the touch, but not so hot that it may cause concern. I did not use the included usb power adapter, since it is not UL rated, but I used a generic adapter rated at 2A that is UL rated and double insulated for peace of mind. The mini pc stick itself is wide, much wider than a common USB thumb drive, so it may actually take up enough space that you will not be able to connect to an adjacent HDMI port, get an HDMI extender cable to prevent this device from taking up an adjacent HDMI Port. The wifi is totally unreliable, my mini pc is about 4' from the router, and even then, it will not maintain a solid connection. The Bluetooth is also affected by RF interference, be it from a 2.4Ghz wireless keyboard or other Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth will work, but you have to make sure its enabled first thing after you power on the device, and even then, you may have to reboot the mini pc to make the Bluetooth stable. I use Bluetooth headphones with this device, and it has a nasty habit of making the video stutter, either local playback or streaming, when I adjust the volume on the headphones. My solution to this is to not change the volume while a video is playing.  Manufacturer support is completely non existent, the instruction sheet does not list any manufacturer website or a source for updates, so expect to be on your own. The instructions included are in badly translated English, but if you are familiar with an Android phone or tablet, you should not need them. Instructions indicate that you do not need external power, that it can get power from the HDMI port, this is not true.

"I realize the title of this review is a little misleading for anyone who has seen this thrilling film from director John Frankenheimer and is aware of the ending but I couldn't resist. Just in time for it's 50th Anniversary, Twilight Time has given ""The Train""(1964) a nice Blu-ray upgrade that is a vast improvement over the standard DVD released by MGM years ago. The story takes place in the final days of the German occupation of Paris(August 2, 1944) and concerns the stealing of some of France's priceless paintings (Renoir, Degas, Gauguin, etc.) by an obsessive Nazi officer and brings into question whether such art(priceless or not) is worth dying for. That cost(human lives) is the central theme of Frankenheimer's film which holds the viewer's interest right down to the sad and haunting end without any need for dialogue. That's all I'm going to say about the plot. As far as the video quality, Twilight has done a pretty good job considering what they had to work with. ""The Train"" was originally released by United Artists whose films are now owned by MGM. In licensing it's titles for Blu-ray release, Twilight is pretty much at the mercy of the studios as far as what print it provides them and sometimes that can be problematic(as in the case of Twilight's ""Jane Eyre"" Blu-ray). For the most part, the print provided by MGM looks in pretty good shape for it's Blu-ray debut but there are still some issues. Those annoying white specs show up from time to time and some scenes appear softer than others. Thankfully, the only film damage is during the closing credits. All in all, the picture quality is very pleasing due in no small part to it's cinematography. Frankenheimer's decision to film ""The Train"" in black and white makes what unfolds in the story all the more stark and somber, with the blacks and grays casting a pall over the entire proceedings. This new Blu-ray brings all that out but those expecting a ""Criterion"" video picture should lower their expectations and just enjoy the film. As far as action films with a message, it doesn't get any better than ""The Train"". Frankenheimer's filming of the action sequences(before CGI) are just astounding. Yes, those are real trains and Spitfires. The performances by the two main protagonists, Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield, are superb and both are supported by a great supporting cast of French actors(including Jeanne Moreau). On another note, Lancaster does all his own stunts which only adds to the authenticity of the film. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is exceptional with dialogue and sound effects being loud and clear. ""The Train"" is 133 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.66.1 in B & W) and contains only the following subtitle(English SDH). Special features include an isolated music score by Maurice Jarre, two audio commentaries and the theatrical trailer. The Blu-ray itself is housed in a solid Blu-ray case(not one of those Eco cut-out cases) and includes a very informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo(Note: I purchased this directly from Screen Archives Entertainment for less than what some sellers are asking). Burt Lancaster and John Frankenheimer made five films together over their long careers and ""The Train"" was one of their best. It should be a part of any film collector's library and comes highly recommended.","06 24, 2014","""THE TRAIN"" FINALLY ARRIVES ON BLU-RAY",1403568000,MovieTV

"This was a 5 star movie to me until I got to the end. Having seen the short film Float, on which this movie is based, I was so pleased to see production qualities in nearly every area greatly improved over the original. The movie captivated me and got me emotionally involved in the story line. The acting was outstanding. Layers of sub-stories were added to the original, adding complexity and mystery to the story. But when I got to the end --SPOILERS AHEAD--, I was blown away at the changes to the original ending. The killing of one of the two lead characters was completely unnecessary, in fact it did violence to the rest of the storyline and felt out of place. It was a gratuitous attempt to add drama to the story, making it a tragedy instead of a true personal triumph and overcoming. I went back and watched Float again, and though the short film had many rough edges, the ending was consistent with the progression of the storyline. I am torn with giving Rivers Wash Over Me 5 stars for its excellence in nearly all ways, and 1 star for the betrayal I felt with the altered ending.

If you liked Transformers, you'll like Battleship.  There's a fair amount of humor as well, especially toward the beginning.  The scene where Taylor Kitsch's character goes to extreme lengths to get a burrito for a girl is actually based almost frame for frame on actual surveillance footage of a comical burglary of a convenience store which occurred several years ago.  This movie could be a 2 hour long recruiting video for the Navy.  Fighting ships and all forms of naval hardware are showcased left and right.Before the movie was released, a lot of people made quips about how elements of the original board game would be incorporated into the film.  Well... that's exactly what they did!  The main defensive weapon on the alien ships hurls explosive shells that are shaped like the plastic pegs used in the game.  There's a scene during a night battle where naval officers are breathlessly staring at a computer-generated grid while a captain gives out targeting coordinates for missle strikes.There is a long list of things in this film that just made no sense.  For example, the aliens in the film are a paradox.  They have ships that can travel across light years in no time and can generate impenetrable energy shields.  On the other hand, their ships' main defensive weapons are no more effective than conventional artillery.  And for a space-faring race, they don't seem to be very smart.Despite its many flaws, I still enjoyed Battleship enough to give it 4 stars.  It doesn't deserve 4 stars, but it's just a fun movie.  It just requires a big dose of suspension of disbelief.","05 29, 2012",A Fun SciFi Action Flick,1338249600,MovieTV
"This phone has a 4-inch IPS LCD screen and runs Windows Phone 8.1. Windows Phone OS, unlike Android, does not spy on its users.  Many apps have icons called Live Tiles which can show additional information, so you don't have to open the app to see the essential info.  Not all Live Tiles are useful, though, same situation with Windows 8. The developer has to make his or her Live Tile useful. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Bing Weather, Bing News, etc. all have super useful Live Tiles. The 520 has tons of features for this price. Two things that ARE missing are a front-facing camera, so Skype is not too useful here if you want to do video chat, and back camera flash. The 5MP camera works really well outdoors but can be grainy indoors, typical of medium-range phone cameras. After all, this is no Lumia 1020 or even 92x. The LCD screen is very nice, though, and the touch function works as well as on an iPhone which is to say the best!  The large icons -- you have three sizes to choose from -- are super easy to read, a great break from the tiny icons on the iPhone and Android. A recent reports says over 70% of American adults suffer from eye fatigue due to using smartphones and tablets. I can tell you that after I started using Windows Phone my eyes have gotten less dry. The 520 makes clear calls. Like all Nokia phones, though, the vibrate function is a little lame. But I don't use vibrate at all, so it's not an issue for me at all.While the phone is the best smartphone for the price, AT&T; Wireless stinks, period. With smartphones, AT&T; does not allow you to add a pay-per-minute plan. You must choose a monthly plan, starting at 25 dollars per 30 days.  T-Mobile is better in this regard, but AT&T;'s network is 10 times better than T-Mobile's, so it's a trade-off I'm willing to accept.  I use a Lumia 925 as my main AT&T; phone, but leave a 520 in my car as a backup phone and also my son carries a 520 to school. He loves it, too. Windows Phone has Kids Corner which limits the phone's functions, for instance it limits the maximum volume, and it's a great and reliable way, unlike a few Android offerings, for kids to use the phone.","01 20, 2014",Little phone that's super capable,1390176000,CellPhone

"Upon first spotting the Plantronic Backbeats earbuds, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The case itself is very eye catching, and immediately draws the eye.  And I have to say that you can easily tell the quality of the earbuds by how much thought was given into just showing them off in the case.  The packaging has a magnetic cover, that when opened reveals the earbuds in a nice, tight, indented container.When opening the package, the Plantronic earbuds easily slide out in their cardboard casing along with a small cardboard box that has two areas to open.  One side houses the charger, and another smaller box that contains the various earbud sizes, and the other contains the manuals.  The smaller box with the earbuds in them opens to reveal, again great packaging, two different earbud sizes, small and large, as the medium ones are already on the earbuds.  The actual Plantronics Backbeat earbuds are a nice size, and very good quality.  Each ear has a stabilizer, or thin piece of clear rubber that adheres to the inside of your ear to help stabilize and keep the earbud in your ears.  I don't know about anyone else, but I actually do have difficulty keeping earbuds in my ears.  But happily with the stabilizers they manage to stay in fine, even with me doing a full out run instead of a normal jog.  About halfway down the earbuds on the right ear is a little area that does everything.  It has three buttons on it, a minus, a stop sign, and a plus sign.  The little button in the middle acts as the go-to everything button.  It is used for playing music, pausing, turning it off and on, declining calls, receiving calls, and even for syncing your devices together.  Syncing my devices took seconds using these earbuds!  I literally turned on my Bluetooth, searched for devices, and then pressed the power button.  Lights on the earbuds flash, and you'll hear a female voice saying that your device has been successfully paired.  Easy as can be!!  These earbuds are sweat proof too!  While I don't sweat that much around my ear area, my boyfriend does due to the different workouts he does, and nothing has shorted or anything else! The manual does say it has over 4.5 hours of music listening ability, and five hours talk time, but I've listened to music for days now, and it is still alive!  I do turn it fully off though when I'm not using it although it will go into a deep sleep to save battery life.  Now, for taking calls, and speaking to it...you must have data on on your cell phone.  Most people have tons of data nowadays, but I'm still old school with a minimum as I get wifi everywhere.  So that's one thing that sucked for me.  But calls did work well when I took them, and I could hear everyone fine, and they could hear me just as clearly.  The actual sound quality isn't that fantastic to me personally, but it still works fine for my runs.","08 25, 2013",Great Earbuds for a Lifestyle that's on the Go!,1377388800,CellPhone
"I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since high school days in the 60's. I've read all of the Conan Doyle novels and short stories at least five times, maybe more. To be honest, I didn't believe this modern day Sherlock would work but it does - better than I ever could have hoped. The characters, and the stories paralel the originals with just enough twist to make for great entertainment. Better still, there is an element of humor that is missing in the original stories that makes watching all the more fun. I would recommend the videos to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.

"OK, so I'll say upfront the camera is well built...mostly metal some plastic, but a solid build...the 18X zoom is great for a point and shoot.  The Wifi feature is what sold me on the camera...now after saying that I will say that it has been failing just as much as it has been working...I constantly try uploading pics to Facebook direct from the camera and and I continually get a upload failed error after only one or two pics, so I have to get online to see which ones were uploaded or I end up uploading several duplicates (kind of defeats the purpose if I have to check as I'm not saving time)...the 1st couple of times I tried it worked fine...recently it hasn't been working as well.  Another awesome feature is the Remote View Finder...It does work with my HTC Sensation and I would think it would work with any newer Android phone.  Some people say they can't get it set up or it's hard but it's really not that hard.  You activate the cameras Wifi function, then connect your phone to the WB150F ""hotspot,"" then select the app and from there you can control the veiwfinder (zoom, timer, and shutter) or transfer pics. Also it does have a completely manual function, which I haven't used yet, but you don't see that much on a camera at this price.  Also I do like the editing feature built into the camera and also the features on the Samsung software....you can do things like create GIFs, which is pretty cool.  Now saying all those good things I will say that the auto focus takes quite a bit of time to work and there is some lag.  The burst shots are cool but are taken @ 3MP...a lot of the cooler functions downgrade the pic quality to anywhere from 3-10 MPs.  I've seen better pics from a sub $200.00 camera but this one is alright...I do think picture quality in low light is below avg and grainy but outside it's fantastic.  All said I gave it 4 stars as I'm glad they are finally putting wifi into digital cameras so I don't have to take so many shots on my cell.","06 25, 2012",Wifi in a camera....since when?,1340582400,Electronics

Why spending so much money on others when I can have this performance for less?Pros:-Front camera for video chat.-Micro sd slot, I just copied my stuff (avi, jpg, etc) and this tablet can read it all.-Size!

It fits on any cargo pants pocket.-Honeycom... first android made for tablets.-I can have all my kindle books on it too!!-Play apps... no restrictions from the vendor.-Charger: it has an USB port. I even used it to charge my cellphone when I forgot to bring the cell charger on a trip. One charger can be used for a lot of gadgets. Moreover it came with diff connectors (forgive my English.. I don't know if this is the proper word)so you can use the same charger on USA, Europe, South America or wherever you go. No need to have a converter.-Connects automatically to wifi on file and downloads firmware updates automatically too.Cons:-Can't close apps (although this is no a tablet's problem but android)-Charging time (takes more than other tablets to charge)-My kid loves it so it is hard to use it when he is around!  ;)I thought about giving 4 starts due to the closing apps issue.

"This re-issue of the 55 CDs from original recordings is not a copy-reissue, but an entirely new issue from original tapes, and this speaks a lot on the magnificient sound of the individual discs.I owned the vinyl LP of Leppard's Brandenburg Concertos in the 1970's. It is of course a joy to see it being digitised by modern avante garde technology instead of the early and crude digital equipments.The re-issue here is  vastly different from the early digitised sound, as evident in the vocal sets like 'Il Barbiere di Sivigli' by Marriner and the 'Il Corsaro' by Gardelli.  Even the 'Requiem' of Peter Schreier gets a better 'sound' than the Grammophone award winning CD originally re-issued in the 1990's.So much on technology.The contents are truly interesting. I do not have the good fortune as a good friend of mine who owns over 3000 vinyl LPs issued since the late-1960's.  However, there are certainly vintages in this box set that deserve much better accoustics than the hard,brittle and tinny sounds of early digitisation.  Some artists benefit particularly well from this more avante-garde transfer, as for instance the great Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza, who gets three pieces of works in this box set re-issue: the Mozart 'Requiem', the Rossini opera 'Il Barbiere', and the Rossini 'Stabat Mater'.Other great musicians getting a good coverage are conductors Haitink (4 works), Colin Davis (4 works), Marriner (3 works), Gergiev (3 works), Edo de Waart (2 works), Markecitch (2 works), pianists Brendel (3 works), Kovacevich (2 works), and singers (apart from Araiza's 3 works), Norman (2 works), Ameling (2 works), and instrumentalists like Holliger (Flautist) 2 works.","01 6, 2013",Probably the best box set of classical music to-date.,1357430400,CDVinyl

"So short and sweet without real spoilers, this is a great tekken game. But, when you get to the final boss fight, you will find yourself easily frustrated by how easy it is for you to lose. I actually sat and counted the number of times i hit and the boss hit, and you have to hit them 2x more to win (solo). Haven't tried with the ""strong"" characters yet, but at least for many of them, this is approximately true. And if you miss an attack or they boss counters, be ready to get juggled like nobody's business. Not to say that this isn't beatable, but for a beginner to the series, I could see how this fight could turn them off from the arcade aspect of the game. I mean, who likes to be popped up one time and never be able to reach to ground again? My friend tried to play (first timer) and it took him over 30 minutes just to beat the boss (25 total tries). And he was playing on the easiest level. Needless to say, Namco is really making you earn those endings this time around.But other than that, this is a fantastic game. The customization isn't as nice as Tekken 6 and they did away with the main Story mode, but there are more characters, nicer graphics, smoother play overall, and, of course, MORE CHARACTERS!!! including some we haven't seen in the series for quite some time. Haven't tried online play yet, but the 4 player mode is surprisingly fun. Just make sure that the two teams are balanced so the other side doesn't end up throwing the controller at the wall....

My copy of that card writes at 38.5MB/s.  This Kingston card comes in second.  Transcend's UHS-1 card comes in around 28MB/s.  Last is the Komputerbay 600X 40MB/s card, which actually writes around 16MB/s.So I think I'll be sticking with SanDisk cards.

"I purchased this and was super excited that I could theoretically  plug my sd card in and immediately see the pictures and share them wirelessly with others........well, that's the theory.I plugged in my sd card.  Joined the network from  my iPad 1 and iPad 3 and iPhone 5 (not at the same time, even though theoretically I can).  After getting into the sandisk app, I could see my media card.  I pressed the photo and immediately saw 2-3 thumbnail pictures and so I got really excited.  This is when the disappointment comes in.  Pressing on the thumbnail pictures, it took about 10 seconds to load one picture for me to see the picture.  I tried the next picture and same thing.  However, after the third or fourth picture, it loaded up and all I see is a red block, not even a thumbnail picture.  I restarted, and same thing.  I got 3-4 thumbnail and if I just scroll down, I would see small red blocks.  Apparently this thing is so slow that it cannot even show the thumbnails.  I left my iPad there for about 15 minutes and when I came back, I could see about 20-30 thumbnails now.  So this thing works, but it's very slow.  Maybe it's because these pictures are from a dslr and so  it's having problem with larger files?I wonder if this will work better with a smaller camera with smaller files.Also, just wanted to let you know that it will not see raw Nikon NEF files.  It says incompatible file.  I tried watching videos that I took from my Sony camcorder, and it say incompatible files also.

"My wife loved the 12000 mah itrent battery I had bought about two years ago. It requires its own charger and is a little blocky dimensionally. But it was good for her use profile. She ditched it on an overseas trip before I could evaluate her claim that it failed. I saw this when shopping for a replacement. It had an additional 1000 mah another USB port and it did not require a separate charger and it doubled as a flashlight. The unit could discharge fast enough to charge am ipa and an iPhone simultaneously.The lack of a charger has been a small problem for her because she doesn't seem to Mage the different I/o rates. She does know why the device won't charge when she uses her laptop USB port to recharge the battery with the iPhone plugged in. Recharging at a decent rate will take a high current source like a 2 amp USB outlet. Most USB plugs a less than 1 amp.Once she got the battery charged up it worked as advertised.

"Self Storage (Tom DeNucci, 2013)I was sitting on the couch today watching movies and writing my review of the execrable pile of dog dung that is Infected, and when I clicked on Tom DeNucci's name, I saw that he was involved in Self Storage, a movie I had just added to my Netflix queue a few days before. Thus it was that I found myself watching Self Storage a few hours ago. It is not by any means, as awful a film as Infected. Not a great film, by any means, but not a terrible one, either. Though take with as much salt as necessary, given that I'm a sucker for Michael Berryman.Plot: Jake (DeNucci) is the night guard at a self-storage facility in the middle of nowhere. He's just been chewed out by his boss Walter (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) for slacking off on the job when he gets a call from his old pal Rip (Ben Gracia in his first screen appearance); Rip was on his way to a party, with five friends when the location fell through, and can they drop by that night and get plastered? Jake has resolved to straighten up and fly right until he overhears a conversation between Walt and Trevor (Below Zero's Michael Berryman); they are planning to close the facility and let Jake go the next day. Party on? Party on! I'd love to say more about this, but we'd be getting well into spoiler territory; let's just say the party does not go quite as planned.DeNucci started out working with Glenn Ciano, and to be blunt, he hasn't quite washed the grime off yet; Self Storage is better than Inkubus and is playing in a whole different zip code than the godawful Infected, but it's still somewhat trite, and you'll see most of the twists coming long before they get there. Still, there are a few good acting turns here, and the movie is a bit more understated than the poster would have you believe; not something to go out of your way for, but with a little improvement in the writing and the development of his own directorial style, Tom DeNucci could potentially be going places, and you may well be able to say &#8220;I watched him when&#8221; in a few years. **","02 26, 2014","Access code, please",1393372800,MovieTV

"I've been using these earbuds for a couple weeks now, and I'm quite pleased with them. Obviously nowhere near the quality of $50+ up earbuds, but they're darn good for $7. I got them because, while I prefer using my Sennheisers, I like to have earbuds every so often to use at work or for a quick commute. I noticed that the Monoprice 109927/108320 seem to get far better reviews than these, and seem to be the most preferred in this price range, but I hate earbuds that have to loop around your ear. I wear glasses and have a piercing on my upper left ear, so the wires can get really annoying. I know you don't have to wear the headphones like that, but I heard it greatly improves them.In the end, I opted for these 9396.I didn't use the ear pads they came with (they come with three different sizes); rather, I used the Comply foam tips, which work great. The sound is good, though there is indeed a break-in period. I didn't even know what a break-in period was for headphones, but I immediately heard a warmer sound after about a day or so. I use them with the FiiO E11 amp, and the music sounds so good.They're great earbuds in general, amazing for their price.

"It amazed me to see so many 1-star reviews for this film, so I thought I'd offer my two cents worth. ""Young Adult"" is not a rom-com. It's a cruel dark look at the life of an emotionally fractured person (Charlize Theron) who thought she had it all figured out in high school, only to be confronted with real life after graduation. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but I will mention how heartbreaking it is to watch a person struggle beyond her means to even comfort herself. There is no transformation, no salvation, things do not get better. It is not hopeful, and does not pretend to leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Letting you off the hook at the end would insult the viewers as much as it would insult the honesty of the form in which the characters were written.If you want to be entertained, anything Jennifer Anniston has produced would be able to amuse you without altering your sensibilities. However, if you want to see what happened to the prom queen and are prepared to watch a film that has the potential for testing your emotional response, you've come to the right place.Bottom line: This film is unconventional and defies strict genre classification; it is not just a `black comedy', it is a `black comedy spending the holidays alone'. Having stated that, no film-lover should miss the performance Theron delivers, as well as the supporting cast - Patrick Wilson & Patton Oswalt.","05 7, 2012","This is NOT a rom-com, thankfully.",1336348800,MovieTV

"Other reviews are correct:  One needs to buy a one-time USB interface to temporarily contain the new drive for transferring / cloning the existing drive - for laptops; I used Vantec NexStar USB interface, which worked, but like other reviewers, I say this is a one-time deal, because it seems a bit flimsy - the connections are a bit marginal, as well.Although Seagate provides DiscWizard for free, it will not clone for free.  So I found Macrium Reflect cloning software, which worked and is free.  If more than one partition is cloned, another free s/w product for moving and resizing partitions (after cloning) will be needed:  I found EaseUS Partition Master on CNET, which finished the job.Additionally, in order for Windows Vista and 7 to ""see"" the USB interface with the new-to-be-cloned Seagate drive, one must initialize it: Search ""Computer Management"" and then click on Disk Management to find the new Seagate drive; make it active and do a quick format.Afterward, use Reflect for cloning of existing drive to the Seagate Momentus XT; use the EaseUS partition software as needed.  After the cloning is finished - about two hours or so for 100GB existing, repartition as needed; shut down; interchange drives and reboot the new Seagate Momentus XT.Not a piece of cake, but an entire cake!  Could get messy, so make sure your data is backed up.The Seagate product works as advertised (for me); boot time is about 65% faster; all other functions are considerably faster - email, large database searches, and general speed of applications are faster.

"In 1998, Cher completely changed her style and released an electronica/dance album. This album was the biggest success of Cher's career, and it's not hard to see why.Believe: A #1 hit, and it was a great one. One of the best hits of the 90s that will be remembered forever.The Power: A more mellow track. Not as fun as other tracks, but a good song nonetheless.Runaway: An awesome dance track that should've been a single. May be the best song on the album.All or Nothing: This was a great single that should've been a way bigger hit than it was.Strong Enough: Cheesy, but in a good way. Great disco beat and lyrics similar to I Will Survive. Should've been bigger.Dov'e L'amore: Cool Latin-flavored song. Not as dancey as other tracks, but still a worthy track.Takin Back My Heart: A good mid-tempo track. Has some R&B; flavor that adds more variety.Taxi Taxi: Repetitive, but tons of fun and a great beat. Could've been a good single.Love is the Groove: A dance ballad, it's probably the weakest track on the album, but it's still quite good and worth listening too.We All Sleep Alone: Awesome dance remix of her 1988 hit. Not much else to say.Overall, Believe is definetly an album you should listen to.

"You 'gotta' take a look at this movie.  It features an adult man and teenage girl presented as heroic anti-heroes who 'get even' for all the stupidity of some of the rankest pop 'culture' in the USA.  Yep, it's a sewerpipe straight from Hollywood (where else) spewing out murder spree after murder spree under cover of 'critiqueing' the sleaze present in the US culture.  Portrays anyone of a conservative bent a crazy hate-monger and the liberals are presented as idiots for the most part,but as mostly better people than the conservatives.  That's to make sure it doesn't offend the chief audience it will garner.  I really have no quarrel with the latter presentation, but the caricatures are so transperent it's foolish.  Anyhow, it's a good flick for ""male anger ventilation"" in the world of the imagination (possibly women too, but I'm not so sure).  But for anybody under 30 years old (maybe 45, maybe 50) it is a movie that shows the actualization of mass murder perpetrated on innocent citizens like we see happening in the news.  This stuff (these presentations) has/have been going on for years and people wonder ""What's wrong?""  ""Why would anyone do this?"" in reality.  I'll tell you why.  A good example is a Super Bowl commercial.  Why do they cost 50-60 million (or more) for 30 seconds of air time?  That's because television and movies ""really don't have an effect on anyone"" right?  Keep the sewerpipe open and prepare for more of the same in your daily news.  Don't go around wondering why this stuff happens.  It's not weapons or guns, it's Hollywood (or, the ""movies"" if you will).  They glorify the stuff.  Ain't no ifs, ands, or buts, about it.  Pretty good acting by the main guy.  The 'girl' does OK also.  Kinda has a pedophilic undertone at times, but mainly handles the two characters well in that regard.  They both have a certain conscience about some things.....so I hand them kudos for that.  But the rest - The movie should be released as Restricted to Audiences Over 50 Years of Age.  Let the sewerepipe roll on and quit blaming gun people (of which I am not one of) for the actual murders we are seeng in our society and put the blame where it belongs, Hollywood!  Have fun...I did!

"Two best friends re-live their incredible 25,000 mile journey followingMarco Polo's fabled routes through the east.They had no crew, no support team, just two guys from Queens, New YorkCity with a bunch of cameras and video equipment in their backpacksslogging alone through unbelievably difficult territory, risking theirlives by crossing into hostile countries without visas, or enteringstrictly forbidden areas. Sometimes they would get stuck in a locationfor weeks before being able to find a way to go on.But these are two tough, as well as endearing dudes. They seemed tomanage to make friends wherever they went, but also to stare downChinese army officers with nothing but a bluff.It's interesting and effective to see these guys, now ten years older,reliving the journey in an interview setting, inter-cut with theirvideo footage and still photographs of the journey. You get both theimmediacy of the events, and the benefit of hindsight and memory.Even though the film is only 90 minutes, it somehow doesn't feelrushed, although I could have happily watched hours more.

"I'm going to go ahead and say it, Amaryllis from Shinedown will likely go down as being one of the most underrated rock albums of the century and I'll tell you why.  After the unexpected commercial success of ""The Sound of Madness"", most people will listen to this album with the initial assumption that Shinedown doesn't have it in them to continue making good quality music.  Because of this assumption, it is reasonable to have low expectations as you start listening to the songs.  I'll admit that I was guilty of this assumption when I first listened to these songs, and was disappointed after the first listen.  This disappointment could have been partly due to the terrible lyrics of the first single (Bully) that came out, or the almost Coldplay-type sound of the beginning of ""Unity"" that Shinedown released a music video to prior to the release date.I quickly overcame this disappointment as I started paying close attention to the lyrics of songs other than the initial single.  After a few more listens, I even started to come to the realization that the lyrics of songs such as ""I'll Follow You"" and ""Amaryllis"" could challenge those of even the most recognized bands in history.  And although a great portion of the songs are more mainstream than the original Shinedown sound (with the exception of ""For My Sake""), is there honestly any other mainstream music out there that you would rather listen to?All I know is the decision to reject my initial gut feeling of this album allowed me to realize that this album greatly exceeds the quality and maturity of their preceding album, and it's too bad that many of you won't feel the same.  However, if you get rid of the initial assumption the Shinedown has ""sold-out"", I promise that you will be in for a ride unlike any other!","03 27, 2012",Amaryllis - The Most Underrated Rock Album of the Century (So Far),1332806400,CDVinyl
"Okay, I remember watching Disney movies when I was a kid and aside from maybe Aladdin and the Lion King, they were all pretty much awful. I just never liked them. Of course, I was never the target market for most of them, as I am not a little girl with aspirations of becoming a princess and being wooed by prince charming. I realize this, and have conceded that most of the stuff my girls are going to watch is going to be really sappy and painful for me to endure. However, I have to say I was really surprised by how entertaining Tangled was. From start to finish the Animation and voice acting is exciting and funny. The delivery of the lines is witty, and all of the characters are really well developed. The plot is entertaining and there is some action but it's pretty mild for the most part. There is one scene at the end that I won't mention here but I had some issues with my girls seeing it and had to do a lot of explaining over it, but other than that it seemed suitable for small children. Really though the most exciting part for me is the fact that I actually enjoyed watching it. I get the songs stuck in my head which is amazing because usually the songs are the worst part for me to watch. Overall I am happy to have something my girls and I can both watch and enjoy. My oldest daughter wants to watch this movie every day and if we didn't limit her TV I'm certain she would just have it playing all the time. She likes other princess movies, but none of them as much as this one, although that could just be because Daddy actually enjoys watching it with her. I would recommend this for anyone with little girls who want to be princesses and if you're lucky, they'll like this more than most of the other ones that make me want to vomit.","02 16, 2012",Review from a father of two little girls,1329350400,MovieTV

"I chose Komputerbay memory for a recent new PC project (10 new desktops and 5 new laptops) because of past good experiences.  This time around, though, has been a nightmare.  Thank goodness for Amazon's gracious return policy!Something has definitely changed at Komputerbay.  Maybe they are too popular and have changed their manufacturing.  I don't know.  I do know that between a dozen different sets of desktop and notebook memory, I was barely ableto find even one set that worked.  Most, when installed, would not allow the computers to even turn on.  I even tried one of the bad sets in my Macbook 17 i7.  It would not turn on.  Just plain bad RAM.I even had Komputerbay specially program some RAM for me for the desktops (PC3-12800 DDR3 that didn't require XMP profile as these new Dell desktops don't support XMP), and was assured they would work, but none of them did.I even repurchased the exact same item from Amazon that I did a few months back, and when I got it, it didn't work.

"Who doesn't love a good disaster flick?  What with the advent of some really high-brow special effects, disaster pictures have grown into a cottage industry.  Whether the world meets its inevitable demise by alien invasion, by some five-mile-wide meteor blasting in from distant stars, or by a plague of flesh-eating insects, Heaven knows it'll all look great up on the silver screen or even on the small screen because it'll be heavy on effects.  RING OF FIRE - for all of its fits and starts - really wanted to show us one possible future for our planet.  So far as this reviewer is concerned, if someone had held the camera still long enough for us to see what it would look like, then it might've been something.Doesn't anyone look at dailies any more?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come', then read on ...)Paxton, Oregon used to be a sleepy little town.  Oh, it had its share of ups and downs as the residents of this TV miniseries will tell you as they recount past deaths that led to split families and even a few divorces.  But when a sinister oil baron (played by TV regular Terry O'Quinn) and his laser drill technology threatens to rip open the very fabric of the Earth, only super-scientist Dr. Matthew Cooper (Michael Vartan) with a pending brain aneurism (???) can save the day using some top-secret space capsule NASA designed to send the first man to Venus!Still with me?As is often the case in the world of telepictures, there isn't an awful lot here that makes perfect sense.  Brushing the science aside, these characters are all troubled by their pasts - and only rising up together in the face of an extinction-level-event can they discover the courage to carry on with their lives, to look past their differences, and to make the planet healthy again.  There's even a soliloquy delivered early in the piece - the story is by William Gray, Steven H. Berman, & Michael Vickerman with a teleplay from Berman & Vickerman - wherein our comely heroine, Emily Booth (Lauren Lee Smith) likens her experiences as a tree-hugging protester to putting the schoolyard bully in his place once and for all to her son whose grasping to understand what mommy's day job is.Plus, it used to be that just regular old oil companies were destined to be carbon copy villains, but RING OF FIRE stakes out somewhat new territory by making their evil corporation a new-fangled oil company with its emphasis on green energy.  (Go figure!)To make matters worse, director Paul Shapiro made the curious decision to shoot the entire motion picture with a hand- or shoulder-held shaky-cam.  Mind you, that works wonders for sequences fraught with tectonic peril (the series felt like one tremor after another); but doing so in endless close-ups only forces your viewing audience to quickly look away and reach for the Dramamine ... which would've been a great use of product placement.Let me be the first to proudly say, ""Bad choice, Mr. Shapiro.""RING OF FIRE is produced by Reunion Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  Well, what I could watch without suffering motion sickness looked and sounded just fine.  Perhaps the smartest decision attributed to this package is that there are no special features to speak of, except for a `sneak peek' at another disaster flick dubiously titled EVE OF DESTRUCTION.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  Look, I love an end-of-the-world flick as much as the next person, but I have to be able to see it - to sit through it - in order to fully appreciate just how grim that end could be.  RING OF FIRE has some of the worst shaky-cam cinematography I've ever seen, not to mention the fact that the story relies heavily on (as best as I've ever read) unproven science.  As disasters go, the performances are just fine; it's the sheer predictability of the story that made it all feel so horribly half-baked.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Gaiam Vivendi provided with me a DVD copy of RING OF FIRE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","06 11, 2013",Disastrous Cinematography Kills Disaster Picture,1370908800,MovieTV
"Let's face it--gay movies are a hit or a miss with not only insipid and abyssal in content, but atrocious in script and acting. Once in a blue moon, gay movie gems would surface and I am glad to have recently discovered ""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" directed by Mr. Casper Andreas and starring Mr. Matthew Ludwinski. The movie concludes with a happy ending and chronicles the challenges and adversity of Adam (Ludwinski) following his dreams and heart of being an actor in Los Angeles. The plot isn't original and I would have enjoyed the movie more had they not include the gossip columnist, Mr. Mario Armando Lavandeira, Jr. (alias ""Perez Hilton"") in a scene near the conclusion of the movie. What gravitated me towards the movie was the journey Adam chose to undertake for the sake of following his heart.""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" explores the adult entertainment industry as the black, kiss of death with the potential to terminate any aspiring actor's career or an alternative, rear entry into the glitz and glamour that is Hollywood, where you are likely to be cast based on association. How far are you willing to go at finding and connecting with the power players? The cinematography and script isn't anywhere close to Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" (for obviously financial resources). Mr. Andreas managed to enlist the help from burgeoning model and actor, Mr. Matthew Ludwinski. It was a delightful cast to see Mr. Ludwinski in a movie. Models transitioning to acting is like watching paint dry. Or I would rather chew cardboard or have my tooth pulled out without any local anesthetic, than watching lifeless actors delivering boring lines!Mr. Matthew Ludwinski delivered a great performance as Adam and his portrayal of Adam won me. While watching the movie, I was saying, ""NO! Don't do that Adam. Don't lose yourself!"" Or ""Way to go Adam, stand up for your principles and beliefs."" I was cheering for Adam's success at reaching his dreams. I think that is the way Mr. Andreas intended--making a movie that reaches out and connecting the audience to Adam. With a handsome, debonair face and sexy body, Mr. Ludwinski is in the right city that's Los Angeles. I look forward to seeing him grow and mature professionally as an actor and model. In the mean time, I am going to find his other movies.Give ""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" a chance. Rent or stream it here on Amazon.com and share your own thoughts and feelings.

"A camera well under a hundred bucks with a 28 mm (35 mm equivalent) wide angle lens? This is rare in cheap cameras,* but you do give up on the telephoto end, going only to 140 mm (35 mm equivalent). So this is a niche camera, but one that would be good for gatherings and party use, where you struggle to get everyone in the picture. It also has the feature that it runs on AA batteries, so you don't have to be tied to a charger; there is good and bad here, as I discuss below.First, to be clear, this is a cheap camera. Very plastic, very few features. This is a snapshot camera for someone who's happy with basic snapshots. And, no, GE doesn't make cameras. As is the case with most consumer products, GE has sold their name and logo to low-end producers. The GE logo on it doesn't signal quality.I used to like cameras that ran on AAs because I could use standard rechargeable batteries, with the backup of disposable batteries in a pinch. That's what I expected to do with this camera. No go. I tried six sets of NiMH batteries, four of those sets freshly charged. In every case it either wouldn't turn on, or turned on with a warning that the batteries were discharged. It appears to be built specifically to run on alkaline batteries, and can't handle the slightly lower voltage of rechargeables. That means you'll be paying for disposable batteries with this camera. And because alkaline batteries drop in voltage as they are used, they probably won't last as long in this camera as in a camera that can operate at a slightly lower voltage.While it does take fairly wide angle pictures, it has severe barrel distortion at the widest end. (In other words, if you take a picture of a rectangle the sides will appear to bulge out in the picture, making it look barrel-shaped.) Some barrel distortion is to be expected, but this camera has it pretty bad. (Not surprising, I suppose, given the low price point.) It may not be too noticeable in snapshots of people, but will be obvious if your scene has straight lines in it.The flash is weak, and even close shots can be underexposed. You can expect marginal performance to ten or twelve feet. The macro is spotty. I got some sharp shots, but in other cases I watched on the screen as the camera went through good focus to out of focus, then took the picture. Outdoor results are fine for snapshots; I wouldn't expect that buyers of this camera would be expecting to make enlargements, which is probably a good thing.If you need a camera at this price and you want to have a fair wide angle capability, this camera may be good enough for you. If you can go to about twice the price you can do a lot better, and you'll be saving the cost of all those disposable batteries.* The sensor chips in digital cameras are more sensitive to the angle the light comes in than is film. That makes wide angle lenses challenging for digital cameras. So cheap ones generally don't go very wide.","10 29, 2011",Sounded like a good idea ...,1319846400,Electronics

It's not as rare as you think.Is this movie watchable? should you watch it?I didn't want to but my inner voice told me that if they can suffer it, you can watch it on tenterhooks waiting for the facts to be reenacted - they never really do - this is all about tender innocent, crying freeman really really wishing they could go home to their geisha wives.And if the Chinese are making this movie, you'd better believe that you're going to burn for this.Minnie Vautrin returned to America and committed suicide in 1941 so apparently, that is ANOTHER good reason that this movie is another Nanjing Lite production; what is this?The Ring (Widescreen Edition)?Grrr.

What about Lindsay Ann Hawker?  Ren&eacute;e Hartevelt wasn't the first girl to be eaten by a Japanese.  It already happened to Chinese girls but that's not in this movie either.

"I have the Weight loss Workout and the Ultimate Workout on VHS, but I bought this DVD because it is easier to move through the  sections.  The Weight loss workout is low impact with two weight segments.  I think these weight segments are what keeps the waist and stomach slim and the thighs thin.  Although this is a low impact workout, you will sweat a lot.  The music is so 80's so I only do my favorite sections which includes the Warm-up (8 minutes) , first weight section (6 minutes)  next two aerobic segments (12 and 6 minutes) and the final weight session (5 minutes).  This gives me a total body workout and allows time for me to do other workouts.The ultimate workout is high impact and balance with isometric exercises.  When I was 30, I could do it every other day, now, I can only get through this workout out a couple times a month.  I feel so proud of myself when I do this, because it takes and enormous amount of energy.  I use this workout as a HITT session.The Ultimate ABS and Thighs is new to me and I plan to incorporate some of that work into my workouts for variety.  This video is 75 minutes, but its broken down in sections that are progressive.  So one can do a 9 minute AB and thigh workout which is plenty for me.I have other workouts that I love because they are more fun, but Kathy is the best.  I've been using her products on and off for the past 25 years and consistently get results.  With her products, I don't hit that plateau, I can lose as much weight as I desire, the only problem is that when I get bored and go to other workouts, I can't maintain the thinness.  So I had to make a decision a long time ago about what the best weight for me is and maintain that, but as I age, I find that I need that jump start, so I always go back to Kathy.","12 20, 2013",Great to Have on DVD,1387497600,MovieTV
"First, all credit to Claudio Abbado, who in these relatively short excerpts from operas establishes the particular sound world of each and (with excellent help from the sound engineers) renders it beautifully and in an ideal relation to the voice.  If one doesn't believe that Abbado is one of the great conductors, this recording should settle the matter.  And in Jonas Kaufmann he has the perfect soloist, for Kaufmann not only sings beautifully and securely, with power and grace, but he too is alive to the particular drama and texture of each piece of music he sings.  There is not a routine moment anywhere on this disc.  To get a sense of Kaufmann's responsiveness, sample the two Schubert items, each calling for a different set of skills: Kaufmann presents them both perfectly, and the excerpt from ""Fierrabras"" is not at all easy to make sound as credible and beautiful as it does here.  My favorite track might be the long scene from the ""Magic Flute,"" starting with ""Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton"" through the dialogue with the Speaker.  First, it's thrilling to hear a voice of this size and quality sing Tamino's music, and then the dialogue with the Speaker is dramatically alive.  Michael Volle is an engaged and very human human Speaker, and he sings both beautifully and with great dramatic sense.  I don't think I've heard the scene done better on record.  The scene from ""Fidelio"" is thrilling too, with Abbado making the lead-in to the aria totally gripping and even frightening, and Kaufmann sounding (as he should) totally crazed by the end.  Siegmund's Spring Song (""Wintersturme"") is ardently done, and in the ""Parsifal"" extracts, both Kaufmann and Abbado show their their mettle -- just listen to voice and orchestra after Kundry's lines in the first ""Parsifal"" track.  Any disappointments?  Not really -- but the ""Lohengrin"" items perhaps suffer a bit from Kaufmann's overworking the dynamic contrasts -- I prefer more direct singing-out (like Siegfried Jerusalem's) in ""In fernem Land.""  But in Abbado's few bars bars of introduction, has it ever been clearer, before Lohengrin even opens his mouth, that we're dealing with a creature from another world?  When Kaufmann does cut loose --  in ""O Elsa, nur ein Jahr"" -- it's simply thrilling.  In short, here's a disc you have to hear.","09 10, 2013",one of the great recital recordings,1378771200,CDVinyl

"The toughest reviews for me to write are the ones that aren't positive, but part of the review process is preventing consumers from making purchases they'll regret.  When I saw this case offered, I thought it looked like a great idea. When I tried it in person, the case didn't work for me.What you're supposed to do is remove your iPhone from the case you've got it in, slide it down into the Katinkas Premium Leather Case. Then, when you want to use your phone, you just pull the handy tab on top and your phone pops out available for your use.First attempt:  My iPhone didn't fit real well into the case. I had to work to get it inside. When I went to pull the tab to remove the phone, nothing happened. That meant I had to use my fingernails to dig my phone out. That doesn't seem like a real smart way to protect my phone.Second attempt:  I put the phone in with a tiny bit of it showing at the top. When I pulled the tab, the phone flew out. Nope, that's not going to protect my phone, either. Leaving part of it exposed doesn't provide scratch protection and I don't want the phone to become a projectile and break, either.I think the key problem with this case is ACCESS. If your phone is ringing or you have an emergency and need to make a call fast, this case is not going to work for you.Further, the leather is not what I would describe as ""premium."" Not sure what portion of the animal the hide came from, but the case isn't particularly pleasing to hold or look at.One use I could think of for this case is for iPod Touch users who carry their Touch around and then remove it to dock into a speaker system or at their computer. If there's no urgency in answering or placing calls, the case might provide excellent protection for both the front and the back of the iPod Touch.Rebecca Kyle, December 2011","12 20, 2011","I might use this for an iPod touch, but not for my phone",1324339200,CellPhone

"I recently purchased thisHP CG790A-AZ 32 GB Flash Memory Card Class 10 SDHC, mostly because it is budget-priced (similar class-10 32GB card from Sandisk would cost nearly twice as much). To my surprise, this HP card turns out to be faster than all my other class-10 cards.I used a benchmark program called ""H2testw v1.4"" to find out the write speed for large (1GB) files. This is essentially the same as the sequential-write speed used for SD card speed ratings. To qualify as a class-10 card, the card must be able to sustain sequential-write speed of 10MB/s.Here are the results for all my class-10 SDHC cards:-HP CG790A: 15.1MB/s (* see update)-Transcend TS16GSDHC10E: 14.6MB/s-PNY P-SDHC16G10: 13.6MB/s-Kingston SD10G2/16GB: 10.7MB/s-Wintec Filemate 3FMSD32GBC10-R: 10.2MB/s(See the chart I uploaded to 'Customer Images')For completeness sake, I also benchmarked this HP card using other programs, including ""Flash Memory Toolkit v2.0"" and ""CrystalDiskMark 3.01"". The results are even more impressive (see 'Customer Images' section for details). The HP card delivered excellent write speed for both large and small files, while all other cards performed poorly for smaller files.Of course, the REAL benchmark needs to be done in the actual application. For that, I inserted each card in my Canon Rebel T1i, set it to save both RAW and JPEG formats, then took 10 consecutive shots in burst mode. Again, the HP card is the fastest, taking only 16.7s to save all 250MB of data. In contrast, the slowest card (Wintec Filemate) took 28.3s to finish.Bottom Line:This HP SDHC card, despite of its low cost (I picked ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging""), is actually the fastest among all class-10 cards I have tested. That makes it the best deal in my book.[Update on June 26, 2012]I purchased another HP 32GB SDHC card, because the current price (66 cents per GB) is just too good to pass up. The read/write speed of the second card is identical to that of the first one. So the quality is consistent.[*Update on May 24, 2013]The old card reader I used (Transcend M5) was limiting the speed of this HP class-10 card. I re-ran the H2testw benchmark with a newTranscend USB 3.0 Card Reader (TS-RDF5K), and the Write speed jumped from 15.1 to 21.3MB/s. The Read speed also jumped from 18.1 to 30.1MB/s, which is limited by the USB 2.0 port I used. I should expect even better results if I had a USB 3.0 port.","06 7, 2012",Top of the class among all (budget-priced) Class-10 cards I have tested,1339027200,Electronics

I'm not an expert on knowing the difference between flimsy and quality cases; whatever I get, as long as it doesn't break within a few weeks, I'm cool with it. This case to me, looks like it's built well, however it has issues.Firstly, the cover doesn't even fold and stay still, it's too stiff. I guess after some X amount of uses, it'll get used to being folded. But it mainly does not even fit my iPad Mini! I tried putting the case on the Mini from the edge side first, but the two corners don't snap and one corner either the bottom or top one of the binding side would not stay in place. If I try using the case from the binding side first, I would push down and it would make strange scratching noises like it would scratch the iPad. Am I doing something wrong? If someone could help me, I'll change my rating. But for now, this case doesn't seem like it fits properly.","05 5, 2013",I'm not happy with this product!,1367712000,Electronics
"... is not only the prostitute Mamma Roma, who attempts to recover a semblance of respectability in order to launch her teenage son toward a better career than either farming or petty theft. Mamma Roma is loud, lewd, vulgar, irrepressible, and supremely vital. Her vitality takes a beating, however, as her son responds to her struggles to educate him with his own stubborn individuality. It's obvious from the start that poverty and societal degradation will thwart a mother's bravest intentions. Poverty IS degrading, as portrayed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, the most ardent Communist among the Italian 'neo-realist' film-makers who emerged during and after the Fascist debacle of World War 2. Pasolini was a poet and philosopher long before he began making films, and he was arguably the last poet ever to be able to provoke frantic outrage in a reading public. ""Mamma Roma"" was his second film, released in 1962. It was and is  nowhere near his most shocking or controversial film. In fact, it's a modest melodrama -- no violence, no nudity, no scatology, no sacrilege -- rendered brilliant by Pasolini's powerful script and by the unforgettable acting of Anna Magnani in the title role.But don't forget that Pasolini was a poet first. This film, so seemingly a tale of personal tragedy, is also a complex symbolist image of Italian society. Mamma Roma the woman is a synecdoche of the city Rome, the ""eternal mother"" of Western civilization. Rome is as much the title character as Magnani, and Rome is also a worn-out but enduring putana (the Italian word for 'prostitute'). The setting of the story in effect tells the story. Mamma takes her son to live in a spanking new housing project (the EUR district, I believe) that abuts both a vast weedy spread of ruins from the 1st or 2nd Century, chunks of masonry and indecipherable shattered arches, where the young Romans of today misbehave, and an equally vast ""thieve's market"" adjacent to the produce market where the new Mamma has a fruit stall. On one level, that's merely realism; the city of Rome has always haunted its own ruins. On a more poetic level, that's all of modern capitalist society, a breeding ground of futility for the Poor amid the ruins of departed Grandeur.I lived in the Rome captured in this film; I arrived in Roma in the 60s and settled in an apartment overlooking the Camp de' Fiori, with its monumental statue of Giordano Bruno. It's quite exciting to see the Roma of that era in a film, apart from the merits of the film per se. Central Roma is not the same today; you'd need to seek out the remotest slums or to go to more southern cities to observe anything like the Italy Pasolini portrayed. The language of this film is also specific to an older Roma. The only character in the film who speaks ""school"" Italian is a smug priest whom Mamma consults in a single scene. All the others speak distinctive dialects, particularly the lower-class Romanaccio dialect that will defy the understanding even of other Italians. In the Roman dialect, ""andiamo"" (let's go) becomes ""nammo"" and ""ascolti"" (listen) becomes ""ao"". It's a loud, pushy, exaggerated dialect, and just hearing it makes me nostalgic.","11 2, 2011","The Eternal ""Putana"" ...",1320192000,MovieTV

I can switch between two computers, one a Windows 7 64-bit and the other a Windows XP Pro 32-bit. I did have a little trouble out of the box but that's due more to my limited vision than anything.

Then I got to thinking there might be a second part to that adapter, and sure enough, I missed it first pass in the box but found the other piece, snapped it on and I was in business.Next was doing the hookup. It's pretty darn straightforward. They give you two cables which have VGA attached at one end along with the appropriate flat USB plug to connect to one of your computer's USB ports, that USB plug replaces your mouse and keyboard connection. After I had both VGA and USB's plugged in I then plugged in the keyboard and mouse and monitor to the box and fired up the first computer. As it got into windows it installed the new &#34;hardware&#34; but the keyboard was not fully functional, so I rebooted to see if that would solve the problem, it did. Then I went to boot the second computer and while it booted fine, the mouse light wasn't coming on and neither was the keyboard. After a couple of boots and it still didn't work, I decided to check the wiring again and found the big USB connector for computer #2 had fallen out so I plugged it back in and fired up the computer, the device installed and it all worked like it was supposed to. Then the big test was toggling back and forth between computers, and that worked splendidly. There's just a momentary delay from one computer to the other but no big deal to me, as long as I know the connection is made that's fine. It does seem to do its job as described, it didn't cost me an arm and a leg, and this thing is built very ruggedly so should last a good while. I figure if this unit lasts me until I replace these computers with ones that use DVI plugs or even HDMI, that's fine. as nice as this unit is, if StarTech keeps making them like this I'll upgrade when necessary with one of their units.I initially thought that the lights for each computer were pushbuttons that you could manually select but it doesn't appear that way. You press the scanning button on the right side and it toggles between computers. Very simple to operate.Somebody wrote in one of the recent reviews that they felt this was a Spartan looking KVM and were glad they could hide it from view with all the wiring being in back. I do like that all the wires are in back, I prefer my gear to be that way; however, I LIKE that this is a simplistic looking device that has lights that aren't blindingly bright and on my desk, which is part of a recording studio/DJ setup, it looks like it belongs there. My desk is a techie desk having an audio mixer, keyboard, USB hub, the KVM, a second mixer for audio to the second computer, also there's room for a mouse, my phone, a remote control for a reel to reel tape deck, rack mounted CD players, a mic processor and then a headphone amp next to a production timer. all fit for a radio DJ junkie that produces voiceover material and radio programs. so yeah, the StarTech fits right in with all the other toys.I am still in the testing phase trying to shake out any bugs in this KVM but if t holds up the way it is right now I'll be happy. its $47 price tag through Amazon fit the bill for what I wanted and thus far, this exceeds what I was actually expecting. I'll update if I find anything further, but otherwise I'm happy to give this five stars right now. A very nicely made product and I doubt you will be able to beat it. They do have a four-port model of this type KVM so if you have even more than two PCs or MACs you might consider one of those. Get one of these if you want to link a couple of computers together, I'm certainly glad I did.","08 8, 2013",What A Great KVM!,1375920000,Electronics

"While I found the LG800g to be good and functional after an accident it wasn't working so good afterwords so I had to decide repurchase the 800g or go for this one for the same price.After having this cellphone for about a week I found it to be a good choice,the touchscreen and online capabilities are definitely better then the earlier model and with the added bonus of getting triple minutes instead of double. Again a word of warning though this is a prepaid cellphone and while it does have some decent capabilities it obviously isn't going to match up to a Samsung Galaxy and the like so if you want those bells and whistles you should just get a contract cellphone instead.The cellphone is pretty sturdy about the same as the LG800g and could probably handle a drop relatively safely(Though mine got stepped on by a heavyset person before I could pick it up again)but you can get a protective cover pretty cheap here as well if it makes you feel safer.So again for those who have needed a phone in a dire or problematic situation here's a very affordable one to get without the hassle of signing up for a yearly contract and worrying about monthly costs or early cancellation fees but also remember if you're one of those need to have the latest model to keep with the fashion crowd then obviously this phone isn't going to be for you.","10 8, 2013",Friend Saw Mine Thought It Was A good Deal So Got This One As A gift For Him Which He Was Thankful For,1381190400,CellPhone

"Long time Patrick Doyle fan, and hearing that he was doing the music for ""Brave"" made me instantly excited for this soundtrack.  He gets it just right here, with Scottish flair accenting his solid and melodic orchestral score.  I look for memorable themes in a soundtrack, and I look for them to be used but not overused.  Nothing kills a good theme for me like having it repeated ad nauseum until the entire soundtrack is just the same soundbyte over and over again--but at the same time, it is nice to have poignant moments called back by the use and variation of a familiar theme.  That is what you get here, with some sweet and lilting Scottish flavored melodies varied and repeated at intervals, but not abused.  The action writing is tense and focused, and percussion is strong and interested.  The vocal tracks are warm and sweet, sung beautifully and setting off the rest of the soundtrack like jewels in a setting.  A solid and enjoyable Pixar soundtrack that keeps Doyle as a go-to composer for me.","06 19, 2012","Tense and exciting soundtrack with tender moments, and moments of freedom",1340064000,CDVinyl
"Every superzoom I read about has its tradeoffs. For this the trade offs were not where I was most concerned. Everyone thought the pictures I took were right out of National Geographic (I was on safari for two weeks). I thought the size was good. Very solid feel.  it fit into my front pants pockets fine, but I don't wear tight jeans and generally wore cargo pants or something similar.  I was taking picture like crazy and there is no way the battery lasted for 400 pictures. That is because if you take videos or view you picture, or edit  or delete them, it is easy to use up power. Having a spare battery is smart idea. I go it the night before I left. Bad idea. So it  was on the job training. Not recommended.  Picture quality is great, You can reduce pixels to 10 MP and get great picture (no noticeable difference to the human eye in pics 8.5 x 11 or less)and faster time between shots. 20 MB seemed to take a while, which is a problem if you are shooting special moments (Like cheetahs taking down a Wildebeest or you kid being so cute).  The intelligent auto mode was really effective in taking almost any type of picture. There are also other modes to cover special circumstances (Low light mode without tripod was great) including food and soft skin (why?).  Taking movies was also a plus. HD mode is awesome. It also does MP4 which is important if you are going to post or otherwise share videosI was a professional photographer in my day and a avid travel photographer today. I would sum it like this. Great superzoom, easy to get started, if you just keep it in intelligent auto mode or you can do whole bunch of other very cool stuff if you have the inclination, time, and patience to search for ""how to instructions"". Reliable, dropped it twice, 2,000 shots with no problems. Finding how to do many advanced things are this camera is not easy.

"The Killers' new album, ""Battle Born"" could be their most cohesive and best record to date! I noticed that the fans have been complaining about the ""new"" sound and saying things like, ""It doesn't sound like ""Hot Fuss!"" Well, why would it? Yes, I love their debut album but I've loved ALL their records since then too. This band from Las Vegas, Nevada are so much more than ""Somebody Told Me"" and ""Mr. Brightside"". I wish most of their fans (not everyone, mind you) would stop comparing every album to that one because bands change and their sound expands, and there is absoultely NOTHING wrong with ""Battle Born"". The first time I listened to it, I was instantly hooked! Brandon Flowers voice has never been stronger and the rest of boys have never played better! ""Battle Born"" is a solid rock album from start to finish. There are no fillers here whereas their 3 previous albums had at least 1 to 2 songs that were just so-so. Another gripe from the fans is this album has too many ballads. Yes, there are more ballads but you have to admit, The Killers are at their strongest when they sing and play from their hearts. But no fear, there are some hard rockin' songs like the opener, ""Flesh and Bone"". And there is even a cool alt-country track called, ""From Here on Out"". Other standout tracks include: ""Runaways"" (such a beautiful song), ""The Way It Was"", ""A Matter of Time"" (highly underrated), ""Deadlines and Commmitments"", ""Heart of a Girl"" (romantic as hell), and ""Be Still"". But there is one song that could be the best song Flowers' has ever written, ""Miss Atomic Bomb"". This song has so much emotion and sincerity that it's hard to believe that ""Battle Born"" has been so harshly judged. As you can tell, I LOVE this album, one of my favorites of 2012! Give this album a try, you don't hear this kind of music on the radio anymore and that's a shame because they are so talented and down-to-earth.

"ok first things first. I'm not an audiophile! my approach to this review is to try to convey my impressions of these headphones (cans) with the average user in mind. i work in an office and listen to music about 2-4 hours a day while i work. i plug my headphones into this budget dac/amphttp://www.amazon.com/Syba-Stereo-Headphone-Amplifier-SD-DAC63057/dp/B009WN7QT4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1400275530&sr;=8-1&keywords;=syba+dacmy previous pair of headphones were the Audio Technica ATH M30, which i think are the best overall closed back headphones under $100. my music files range in quality from 196 to 320 kbps mp3 files. i also grabbed some of my old cds and ripped the files to FLAC to see what a lossless source would sound like. lastly, i purchased these directly from Harman Audio factory refurbished. they came to me looking brand new and i cannot detect any issues with them, being refurbs. I've had these cans for a week now so this will be my initial impressions. i'll come back in a few months to give a longer term outlook. I'm not sure if I'm a believer in headphone burn in but these are new with minimal use so if burn in is real, these cans should warm up a bit after some significant use.these are some quality cans! the materials are very sturdy and feel expensive to the touch. they feel substantial while still weighing almost nothing. the leather/pleather (not sure which it is) is soft and durable. these are very comfortable cans to wear. they look impressive and I've had quite a few coworkers come up and ask me about them. they are large on your head, think of two cds clamped to your ears. this leads to an issue many others have experienced. that is proper sealing of the cup around your ear.getting a good seal is challenging at times. my head is a bit big and i still feel i don't have adequate seal. the problem in my eyes is the clamping force of the headband. it's not that strong. you'd think that thick metal band would squeeze nice and tight, but unfortunately it doesn't. i bent mine a bit to increase clamping force but i cant tell if it is squeezing more or not. BUT....if you take an extra second or two to wiggle and press these things around your ears, you can get a good seal. and the seal is essential for sound quality.before i go into detail on the sound quality of these cans, let me talk a bit about what affects the sound quality. these cans can resolve very high levels of detail, so if your source material is of poor quality, the sound itself will sound especially poor. high quality source material tends to really bring these cans to life. so if you have a lot of low quality mp3 files (anything under 256kbps), I'd skip these cans. these cans are very neutral sounding, almost cold I'd say. they don't enhance what you're listening to much. they don't boost any of the frequencies much, in my opinion, so if the original material is flat sounding, then you're gonna get very flat and unappealing sound. my older ath m30s are a warmer pair of cans and add some body to the sound. so they in essence mask or cover up a lesser quality recording. that's just not the case with the k550s. they produce a sound that's very very true to the source material. keep that in mind when considering them. like i said, if you don't have good fidelity source material, these headphones will disappoint you greatly. if your source material is poor, a warmer can like the ath m50 might be the better option.ok lets talk about the sound! first and foremost, as a whole i love them. paired with good source material they are a revelation in clarity and detail. I've read many many people complaining they have no bass, but i disagree! they do not BOOST bass, so any bass you hear was meant to be heard. these aren't beats people. Gnarles Barkley - Transformer is a very bass-centric track and the bass comes through clean and impactful. the bass quality is excellent. i think some people associate quantity with quality. no, these don't hit hard, but they go deep and have a good natural impact. nothing feels artificial about the bass presentation with these cans. my m30s in comparison feel a bit boosted in the bass dept. they punch HARDER, but without as much detail, clouding the mids.since these cans wont enhance or boost bass, material without a strong low frequency will sound a bit flat and lifeless. my Megadeth - Holy Wars track is of lower quality and almost devoid of bass. so listening to it with these cans is depressing, to say the least. i actually go back to my m30s for the album (and most of my bass-less music). but do you blame the headphones for this? in my opinion, no! they were designed to reproduce frequencies as they were recorded. they're not here to color and enhance the recordings.mids i feel are these can's strong point. they're rich and detailed, with excellent detail. i have been listening to all my old music again just to hear things i never heard before. i went through this when i got my m30s, and the K550s can bring even more detail out of the recordings than they can. i hear details like the pluck of a string, or a hand moving along the guitar neck, or the skate of a drum stick along a cymbal. i never heard those small details with any of my other headphones. i thought the m30s were detailed, but these are so much more so. and i find the majority of these detail in the mids and highs. tracks like Greenday - Minority, or Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone burst with sonic detail. there is a heft to the mids that really make these cans sparkle. acoustic guitar sounds especially good on them.highs are as wonderful as the mids. guitar solos like Van Halen - Eruption, or Jimi Hendricks - Purple Haze are crystal clear and vivid. but i don't find them harsh at all. I've read some people say the highs are a big harsh, but i don't feel this at all.all in all i find these headphones to be of exceptional quality. but please do yourself a favor and consider your source materials. if you don't have high quality recordings you will probably hate the sound of these cans. i find myself grabbing my m30s when i listen to some of my crappy recordings. I'm even debating getting the m50s to complement these cans just for that purpose. and I'm going back to all my cd's and re-burning them to either 320kbps mp3s or flac files.a note on 320kbps mp3 and flac. so far i don't have the ear to distinguish them. the flac files SHOULD be better sonically, but i cant honestly tell the difference. I'm still ripping flac files in case i can teach myself how to hear the difference, but honestly, 320kbps mp3s is more than enough to make these cans sing. too bad half my collection is low quality 128 and 196kbps mp3s, and i don't have the cds anymore to reburn them at a higher quality.so you, average guy looking for better than average headphones! should you try them? MAYBE...if you have good source material, and you're ok taking a bit of extra time to get a good fit, then yes. if you want neutral sound without much coloration, then yes. if you want bass that's natural but not overpowering, then yes. if you have crappy source materials, stay away! if you like boosted bass, stay away! if you like an overall warm/fun sound presentation, probably stay away. i myself want to hear what the producers intended, so i like these cans a lot. in that regard i love them. but honestly i hate them too. why? when my source materials are poor, they just sound horrible. they're not perfect, don't expect perfection. they're finicky, fussy, and somewhat difficult to get good sound out of. but if you can just put that little bit of extra energy in, you might find you can love them too. i know i have! i'll update this in a few months to see how they've grown on me, and if the whole headphone burn in thing is noticeable to me and if so, what effect it had on them.UPDATE 5/22/14:ok I've added the Audio Technica ATH M50x headphones as a supplemental pair. I wont go into heavy detail on them, just know this: they have a warmer sound to them and much more impactful bass. the k550 have a very flat sound curve, whereas the m50 have a more U shaped curve. that means lows and highs are more accentuated than the mids. but I wouldn't say the mids are recessed much, as others have said. but the overall impression I have of them is this, they're just more ""fun"" to listen to. the bass, though not nearly as detailed, hits harder. the overall warmer sound does indeed liven up my poorer source material, as I thought it might. so how does this related to the k550?listening to both sets side by side has helped me further appreciate the k550. it also helped me learn more about my own preferences.first, there is no doubt the k550 has a much more open soundstage than the m50. if you were to visualize the performance on stage, you'd think the performers were much more spaced out physically on the k550. with the m50 you'd think they're all bunched up together playing right next to each other. does that have a large impact on the overall performance of the cans? to me not so much. it's a personal thing and everyone will have different preferences. but I easily acclimated to both sets when I'd go back and forth in my listening. and I'd switch constantly. my routine was to close my eyes, turn up the volume to a higher level, then listen to a selected track with the k550. once the track was done I'd switch to the m50 and repeat the same track. if there was a particularly stand out portion of the track, I'd listen to that section only with the two. Greenday - Hold On was a great track with a very eclectic opening, which helped illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of both cans.second, I learned something about my sound preferences. I prefer the warmer sound of the m50 to the flatter analytical sound of the k550 for most of my go to music. you know, the music you tend to go to more than the others? for me it's metal (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Iron Maiden, Slayer). I found myself responding more to the music with the m50. it had a more forceful and impactful quality that made metal just more fun to listen to, FOR ME. but when I'd listen to more vocal-centric music, or classical, I found myself reaching for the k550. vocals on the k550 are so well presented, more so than the m50. I think what really makes the m50 more fun for me is the bass performance. though the k550 bass is more detailed, the m50 just hits harder. it's a bit more muddy for sure, and lacks the nuanced detail of the k550... but it just made me smile and move my feet and head to the music.does this mean i prefer the m50 OVERALL, over the k550? not necessarily. both are excellent cans that have drastically different presentations. when I'm listening to more active, fun material (rock/metal), i definitely grab the m50. but when I'm listening to more complex or acoustic music, i much prefer the k550. listening to KD Lang - Hallelujah on the k550 is such a treat. her soulful voice comes through so heavenly on the k550 i couldn't imagine listening to it any other way. does it sound bad on the m50? not at all! but in back to back listening, i preferred the k550 sound signature more.i know, I'm confusing. and I'm confused myself. i really don't want to keep two sets of headphones, i find myself wasting too much time just trying to decide on which pair to grab for what. so eventually i'll decide on which to keep and which to ditch. but right now only 3 weeks in, i just don't know. both have their strengths and weaknesses. right now I'm having more fun with the m50, but I'm also learning to appreciate the intricately detailed presentation of the k550.so that's my update for now. just wanted to share more impressions with you to help you the reader decide on what you may think is best when you choose. I'd also like to give guitar center a plug here, those guys are just the best! i took my k550 with me and asked if i could audition some headphones. i told them I'm on the fence with the k550 and need some time with other headphones to get a better idea which is best for me. they didn't think twice, they let me grab any of the headphones in stock and sit down for about an hour listening to them all. i listened to the m50x which i bought that day, the shure 840, and two beyerdynamics, the dt770 80ohm and custom pro. the m50 immediately stuck out to me upon listening to them. the beyerdynamic custom pro was fun but i found the sound similar to the m50 but not as detailed. and they were much more $. the dt770 sounded lifeless plugged into my android phone (lg g2). i think the higher impedance (80ohm vs 30-something for all the others) made their performance suffer un-amped. and before you jump on me and say well of course you need to amp them... I'm not carrying a phone and an amp. its my preference. I'm sure the dt770 would sound much much better with an amp. but i want a pair of headphones that i can enjoy without an amp when I'm on the go. so no disrespect to the dt770, it just wasn't going to work for me and my gear. the shure 840 sounded good but just didn't blow me away like the m50 did. so in the end after an hour listening to the same tracks over and over and over and over again with all 4 headphones, i found i liked the m50x the best, of the headphones i didn't own. thank you guitar center.i'll spend more time with both headphones and update this review again once i feel i have more to share. at this point i still love the sound of the k550, and am tempted to raise the score to 5 stars. but their overall fussiness of use is keeping me from doing so at this time. and no i haven't noticed any burn in effect yet from either pair. and they've been playing A LOT. over 60 hours for each. probably 120 for the k550. i leave them both on overnight at moderate volume to test the burn in thing....UPDATE 5/29/14:after hours and hours with both the k550 and m50, I've decided to send back the k550 and keep the m50. though I recognize the k550 are a higher quality headphone, their sound signature just doesn't match up well with my musical tastes and source material. I just have more fun listening to the m50. I wont change my score though as I do believe whole heartedly in what I wrote. when things aligned just right, the k550 were amazing. unfortunately for me and my situation, that alignment didn't occur often enough. I would routinely avoid some of my favorite music with them because I knew they wouldn't sound very good. its a lesson learned for me for sure. thankfully I'm in love with my m50, they are perfect for me and my situation. I have the utmost respect for the k550 and almost kept them as a secondary pair, but budget wouldn't allow it. i'll write up a m50x review when I have some time.","05 16, 2014",An Average User's Review,1400198400,Electronics

"We purchased the LG 32LN5300 32"" television for our toddler's playroom, so we didn't want anything too big or too expensive.  I looked at all our options and narrowed down my search to the LG 32LN5300 based on image quality, features, and price.  My basic requirements were that it had to be 1080P and offer at least two HDMI inputs.  There was one other television that was $50 less than the LG, but I opted for the LG because the image quality was noticeably better and off-axis viewing was far superior.  The other television was an Insignia.The first thing I'll say about the LG 32LN5300 is this television is mostly about image quality; the image quality is its most outstanding feature.  Like most flat-screen televisions, especially on the budget market, audio quality is not its strongest asset.It offers two 10W speakers (20W total) that produce a very nice volume that will easily fill a moderately sized room enough that you can probably hear it well in an adjacent room.  Don't expect to get a nice full-bodied sound with rich low end.  Its sonic body is thin.  With that said, the settings do offer the ability to tweak the audio and you can set the treble and bass.  This helps somewhat and lessons the boxy sound a bit.  Virtual surround settings also enhance the audio effect.  Just be aware that the audio quality is enough to get by, which makes it fine for a bedroom, den, or play room.  If you want added audio quality, consider purchasing a separate speaker system.Where this television excels in its price range is in image quality.  The monitor does an excellent job at projecting a clean image with crisp detail and very nice image contrast and color tone.  There is an abundance of expert settings that allow you to configure gamma levels and many other complex settings that most users will never know how to set.  Some of these settings can get you into trouble, so if you play with them, expect to possibly reset everything back to the factory default if you screw things up.  But don't be intimidated.  The settings are easy to access using the remote and all the basics are there: brightness, contrast, color, tint, backlighting, etc.After initially setting up the television, I wasn't overly pleased with the image quality.  After maybe twenty minutes of customization, I now have things configured and am very pleased with the image quality.  If image quality is important to you, expect to spend a little time configuring the settings to your liking and don't get upset if the first image you see isn't what you expected.  It's designed to allow for user configuration.This television is ideal for applications that don't require extra features or an abundant quantity of inputs and outputs.  The 32LN5300 comes with only two HDMI inputs, one on the back and one on the side.  If you're wall mounting the television, keep in mind that the back HDMI connector requires you to use an HDMI cable with a 90-degree connector or adapter.  If you don't, the television won't lay flush against the wall because the cable will get in the way.Along with two HDMI connectors, the television comes with one composite and one USB input.The 32LN5300 is Energy Star compliant and sips power at a rate of approximately $6 a year when the Eco setting is configured (default).There are a number of reviews that complain about faulty power issues.  Some of these reviews are related to purchasing used equipment.  I'm very concerned about this, but so far, we haven't experienced this problem, perhaps because we purchased it new.  If we do, I'll immediately update this review and report it here.  If you don't see any added update regarding this, our television is working fine.Overall, the LG 32LN5300 is a very nice basic television that produces a beautiful image.  The sound is a bit thin, but the audio can be configured to make the out-of-the-box settings a bit bolder.  It's not built for sound; it's build for economy of purchase and image quality.  We're very happy with the screen quality.  Based on our experience, we would recommend this television for those who need a basic set without an abundance of features or connections.","07 2, 2013",Nice basic television at a very reasonable price,1372723200,Electronics

"There is some confusion about Dragon's Dogma and Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It's worth clearing that up first.'Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen' is a Game of the Year version of Dragon's Dogma, NOT a sequel. It contains the original game, remastered with some graphic and interface improvements, a few fixes, a more advanced fast travel system and a sizeable expansion area called 'Bitterback Isle'.If you have not bought the original game, there is no reason to buy it. Just buy the Dark Arisen version and you'll have everything you need. If you already own the original game, DD:DA may be a steep price for the expansion area, but if you love the game, it could be worth it.Now to the game itself.For me, this game is a revelation. It's hugely atmospheric, the battles are absolutely epic and bucket loads of fun. The Pawn system in the game (NPC's that are created by you and other players) is original and very addicting. The story is slight, but told with a sense of enigma that is reminiscent of the mood of the Demons Souls/Dark Souls games.The game for me is rock solid, especially when considered against Skyrim which is quite buggy and crashes every now and then. DD has not crashed for me once in 50 hours.Gamers are flocking to this title in droves, mostly through fan reviews as pro-reviewers have been slow off the mark. The system here is quite different to 'standard RPG' mechanics and that has thrown some people. I find it a huge breath of fresh air.And the battles! It is honestly very hard to go back to Skyrim battles after summoning Whirlwinds that shoot 100 metres into the sky while you're Strider pawn jumps onto the back of a 30 foot cyclops and brings it to the ground.Personally, the gameplay here for me is the best of the PS3 RPG holy trinity - 'Skyrim' and 'Dark Souls' being the other two. It has the epic landscape of Skyrim with the brooding, hardcore atmosphere of Dark Souls, but it is no way near as frustrating to play as either.There are a few quirks. The game has a very strange relationship to water (basically you just can't go in it for the first third of the game for some unexplained reason), and if you don't have 'Dark Arisen' the lack of fast travel could drive you pretty nuts.But this is seriously nitpicking, because for me, this game is the future of the next generation of RPG's. In a world of risk-adverse, streamlined, dumbed down, insultingly unchallenging cRPG 'product' something finally had to give. Well, here it is... to scratch that party driven, dark fantasy itch. Go get it and enjoy. You will thank me later.","06 3, 2013",Standout A-Grade RPG for PS3,1370217600,VideoGames

"FiiO has hit a home run for portable headphone amplification with the E11, and this Micca deal gives you a spare battery and external charger for the price of the amp alone.What a great deal. Thanks Micca!I've owned and enjoyed HeadRoom's Total Airhead for many years. Adding external amplification to an I-Pod really unleashes the sound, and, with lossless files, puts sonic bliss in your pocket.The FiiO is less than half the size of the Airhead, and adds two stages of user-selectable power gain (important to match with headphones/buds) and a very 'musical' bass boost. Adjusting bass at the amp saves battery drain from the pod's eq setting.The FiiO also runs on a rechargeable, user replaceable battery (with the AirHead I burn through AA's every 8-10 hours). Headphone amps do draw current, and will need recharge/replace much more frequently than recharging the pod. This deal from Micca gives you a second battery and free-standing charger - light and compact, so your tunes are never down for charge (E11 cannot charge AND play simultaneously.)Paired with both cans (B&W;, Dennon, Grado) and buds (Klipsch, Westone) the E11 shines with a performance FAR beyond it's modest price. This is no match for dedicated tube headphone amplification, but that said, the performance/price ratio is simply stunning. Even with my 'street' buds (Skullcandy/Koss) the improvement in dynamics and soundstage is immediate and impressive. Strapped (nylon band is included) to a classic Pod, the whole deal fits easily in a suit jacket pocket. Paired with a nano, it's smaller than a solo Pod.The design rocks - looks like quality gear. Controls are tight and sure. Input jacks feel sturdy. Volume knob (real knob, not digi) is nicely machined and protected from accidental gain by a functional guard (button controls can easily be bumped, causing sudden increases.)Hiss, something other reviewers mentioned, is NOT an issue once gain settings are properly matched to your phones/buds. Settings are easily changed (one internal, one external). Long usage cycles (airplane flights) can be achieved simply by lowering gain and thus increasing battery life.Apple should really be talking to FiiO and adding their products to the Apple Store lineup. The FiiO emphasis on design, circuitry and performance rivals Apple's own considerable attention to detail. This product is an AWESOME VALUE. If you spend any time at all listening to lossless files, you are going to love this.Thank you FiiO. Thank you Micca.

"The sixth of the seven Randolph Scott/Budd Boetticher collaborations returns to Burt Kennedy scripting after two from Charles Lang (""Decision at Sundown"" and ""Buchanan Rides Alone"") and Berne Giler's ""Westbound"".  This one starts out amidst the rocks of the Alabama hills, as we find the lone man, Ben Brigade (Randolph Scott) riding towards the camera through a narrow defile. He dismounts and stealthily makes his way up the rocks towards another man, who calls out to him and ruins the surprise. Billy John (James Best, later known for his role as the sheriff on ""The Dukes of Hazzard"") is a grinning, joking, fast-talking young man who is wanted for murder, and Brigade is a bounty hunter hired to brink him in; but Billy John has a trick up his sleeve - he's surrounded by his men, invisible in the hills. If Brigade tries to take him, he'll surely be shot - and Brigade will have none of it, smoothly facing down Billy and assuring him that they'll both die. Billy calls the men off, and Brigade handcuffs him and rides off with him.So begins the first of the series in Cinemascope, and Boetticher uses the wide format as a master, with the entire film being set outdoors in the vast high desert/steppe territory, a great deal of it on horseback. The two men stop first at Shaw's Junction, one of the tiny little stations in the middle of nowhere that often represent the closest thing to civilization in these films, but instead of being met by the station master they're greeted by a couple of gunmen, Boone (Pernell Roberts) and Whit (James Coburn in his first film appearance). Boone knows Brigade and we soon learn that he and Whit are outlaws, though it's unclear that they are up to any illegal business at the moment. The station master, Lane, has left with some Indians - Mescaleros - leaving his wife (Karen Steele), and this becomes our group of five who must make their way to Santa Cruz, where Billy John is to be brought to justice.Boone and Whit, it turns out, could win amnesty by bringing Billy John in; Mrs Lane rides along as, we found out rather quickly, her husband has been killed by the Mescaleros, who are hot on the trail of the party as they try to make it to another little outpost, a deserted station where they will make a stand against the Indians. Along the way there is plenty of trademark Kennedy-Boetticher sparse, snappy dialogue between Boone and Brigade, and between Brigade and Mrs Lane. It's clear that Brigade and Boone have a certain grudging respect for each other, and they know that they need all the guns they have to make it to Santa Cruz, so an uneasy alliance is formed. Mrs Lane at first dislikes Brigade for his seeming disinterest in Billy other than as a means to money, but slowly we get the impression that there's something else going one here - that it isn't the money, and it isn't even bringing Billy to justice that Brigade cares about.For this is another haunted and ravaged Randolph Scott character, with a dark past, a wife who is lost, and the man who killed her is his real enemy and his real reason for finding Billy and taking him - slowly and carefully as it turns out - towards Santa Cruz: Billy's brother, Frank (Lee Van Cleef). That is the justice that Brigade is looking for, and nothing will stand in his way - nor, as it turns out, does he much care about anything beyond completing this mission, as he waits for Frank to come to him, in the symbolic place where their destinies met before in tragedy.I'm not going to spoil the ending, which is iconic and beautiful in a way that is matched by very few other westerns; suffice it to say that it all comes together symbolically and poetically, and simply in a way that maybe only Boetticher could do it. The supporting cast as usual is excellent, with Roberts especially a standout, as lighthearted and talkative as Scott is dour. Coburn is fine in a role strikingly different from most of his later work, basically a fairly good-natured and stupid yokel along for the ride, but very loyal to his older and more experienced cohort; and Best gibbers away like a maniac, a believable young punk who would murder for no reason. Van Cleef and Steel are fine in slightly less interesting roles; and our hero Scott's stoicism and tightlipped seriousness is as appropriate here as it ever was. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.Tied with the last film in the cycle, ""Comanche Station"" for my favorite, though all of the Burt Kennedy-scripted films in the series (the other two are ""Seven Men From Now"" and ""The Tall T"") are masterpieces in my opinion.  This Sony single on-demand disc appears to be the same transfer as that used in the company's superbThe Films of Budd Boetticherso if you're a fan of the Boetticher/Scott films generally that's the set to get, but if this is all you want or need, don't hesitate.","09 26, 2013",A Man Can Do That,1380153600,MovieTV

Also not noted was that if you use something non-Apple on the Apple ports, it caps out at 0.5A.  This was in the manual, but really needs to be stated in the description, as I had hoped to get 2.1A out of the Apple ports for my other devices.

"The PS2 was my first console and I used to be a total boss at Star Wars:  Battlefront (both 1 and 2) and Burnout 3:  Takedown; I have fond memories of playing the original SOCOM:  US Navy SEALs every day after work 5 summers ago.  Today, I spend most of my gaming time using my XBox 360, but I recently wanted to play some of those classic games again.  Only problem?  My video device is an HDMI monitor, with no place to plug in composite cables.The first step to solving this issue was to buy a converter, specifically this one:New 3 RCA Composite S-video R/L Audio to HDMI Converter.  When I got it, I excitedly plugged everything in and dialed up a classic from 2004, Star Wars Battlefront.  I was quite dismayed to discover that the picture, while displaying in proper scale on my monitor with good audio to accompany it, was incredibly blurry.  Now, granted, I realize that the PS2 graphics are not going to be stellar, as it is an old system.  However, blocky textures and low resolution were not my concern...the image was so blurry and out of focus that it gave me a headache.  After attempting to play on the hardest difficulty, but having forgotten the control scheme, I got frustrated with the game and the terrible picture and gave up.I checked out the ""blurry image"" issue on some internet forums, but the consensus there was that there was no solution; however, most people attributed the problem to the built-in upscaling in HDTV's.  Since I am using an upscaling box, which has generally good reviews here on Amazon, I could not understand why my picture was still so bad.  Finally, I decided to give S-Video a shot, and if it failed, to simply abandon my plan to play old-school games.  The Sony S-Video cable is somewhat costly, but I ran across this Monster one and figured that, for the price and the hyped brand name, it was a good deal even if it did not solve my dilemma.I plugged everything in to the S-video port on the upscaling box and fired up Battlefront again.  To my relief and delight, my picture quality is exactly as I would expect from a PS2!  Sure, the graphics are still rather poor, but the blurriness is COMPLETELY gone.  It's just like playing on my old SDTV.  I can't say that the S-Video looks BETTER than standard composite used to look on the old tube TV, but I can say that it looks just as good, and makes gaming on an HD screen completely possible.While the blue color of the cable might clash with most electronics, mine is hidden under a shelf and thus hardly visible.  The thick cables and gold-plated terminals on this adapter are really nice and have a quality feel.  The ""turbine-cut"" R/L audio plugs seem a little excessive, as I can't imagine there is any benefit to their notches, but they look cool...that was probably the main goal.I know that Monster cables are often regarded as overpriced, but considering that this is cheaper than Sony's lesser-looking offering, and as I can testify works EXCELLENTLY, I think it is actually a great deal.This is a definite must-have for anyone who wants to play PS2 games on a PS2 (as the PS3 sometimes has glitches due to backward compatibility problems) but has upgraded to some form of HD screen.  I would definitely recommend getting an upscaling box like the one I have, because I have read many reports of built-in upscaling working quite poorly.  In my case, I was forced to get one regardless, because my monitor has no composite input.Overall, 5 stars for the Monster PS2 S-Video cable.","09 30, 2011",Excellent Product for all PS2 gamers!,1317340800,VideoGames
"Let's face it; this film has very little to do with being a pilot, flying, a plane crash, etc. It's mostly about a drunk and coke head who befriends a heroin addict.This film has been done many times before of course, even the drunk pilot concept with Cliff Robertson in &#34;The Pilot&#34;. The script writer was able to cram enough elements into this film to have something for everyone...that is except for those of us interested in well done original film-making. It's got a plane crash, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, John Goodman as a coke dealer, a cancer victim, a heroine addict/hooker, a father-son thing, an all-star cast.But the worst aspect of this aside from its trying to squeeze money out of a weak script by over-blowing it, is the unbelievability of the scenario. This is extremely unlikely to occur in a US commercial flight: a drunk coked-up pilot mixed with a catastrophic failure of the aircraft all at once. My final comment is that the actor playing the copilot's wife gave the the most ridiculous performance I've seen in a long time.On one level though they came in for a perfect landing. The destination was the twin airports of BBD (big bucks made by dumbing it down) and ILD (injecting a lethal dose of Stupid into film junkies). They had a slight diversion to the city of BSC (big stars act like cartoon characters), but after connecting through the airport of OHC (overhype and crass), came in smoothly and landed on the tarmac of OPA (overpaid actors) and the final destination of OCM (overcharged moviegoers).I recommend instead 1964's &#34;Fate is the Hunter&#34; starring Glenn Ford and Rod Taylor or my favorite flight film: &#34;Flight of the Phoenix&#34; (1965) with Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough, and Hardy Kruger.","01 4, 2014",Perfect Landing!,1388793600,MovieTV

"Update November 3, 2012If you treat the Bose Sounddock 10 like a self powered speaker the results are very good.  Unfortunately Bose does not tell you this, but the Sounddock 10 should be elevated with rubber feet to isolate vibrations that take away from the sound quality.  What this does is bring more focus to the music. I use seismic rubber feet.  If you can have the Sounddock 10 sit  no more than 5 feet high place it diagonal to a wall the room becomes your speaker.  The bass response is superb. Another words if you could look overhead the angle the two walls are hinged to be the left and right side of a triangle, the Bose Sounddock 10 becomes the long arm of the triangle. At this point you are maximizing overall sonic character and performance, and boy will you be pleased. Outstanding.Update July 4, 2012I have burned in the Audioengine DAC using the Sounddock 10, it is a world of difference. The music has extension, reach, more emotion to listen to.  You don't know what your missing if you have never heard it before.  Vocals are richer and smoother, perhaps overall the 10 has finesse in areas it did not previously.  Stringed instruments have always been a Bose strong suit, they are even more brilliant without being brassy.  Its as if you are sitting next to a guitar, or you are in a nightclub listening to a jazz set, sounds go in different directions but the audio quality never loses its focus.  The audio stage has more space between the instruments, better overall presence and far more attention to detail. Details is where the difference is in this case. The potential of the 10 is on display with the Audioengine D1.  It takes some time for everything to settle in, once it does you can never go back, and going back wasn't bad in the first place. I highly recommend adding a DAC to your set up, you will fall in love all over again, this time for keeps.Update June 23, 2012Bose Sounddock 10 has the innards to be good. I believe it can perform better. I am not satisfied but I haven't given up on it either. I have noticed a fuzzy signature sound that isn't precise.  Its a low level distortion. Of course Bose has the trademark Bose sizzle or esses at the end of lyrics due to the high treble gain. In the next few days I am adding a DAC to the unit using an optical cable from the DAC to the router and a Y link audio plugs to tie it all together. This should make Bose better live up to its billing in my book.TO BE CONTINUEDJune 25, 2012Recorded my source material at 256kbp connected a HRT Digital Audio Converter Streamer idevice turned off the equalizer on ipod classic and it makes a world of difference.  Bass is hard hitting, treble is balanced overall sound is crisp and clear...exceptional sound quality, I mean exceptional.I stand in line with the many others who agree, Bose Sounddock 10 is a worthwhile endeavor. Tenured  jazz artists Houston Person and Ron Carter's Joy Spring played on the bass fiddle and sax choreographs a rare improvised dialogue. Carter's bass fiddle offers a unique lower register exposing whatever audio chops the brand may advertise.  In this scenario, for any audio unit the heaviest of bass notes will either register a clarion note or an annoying buzz, the Sounddock 10 sticks its chest out for such a challenge, it does the same with the Hammond B3 organ. Perhaps the greatest challenge for any system is to discipline the deepest audio registers then fit in a hot tenor sax played alongside to effect like a real world Pied Piper on the musical sound stage.  The Bose Sounddock 10 manages to sonically execute this type of jig with aplomb. The same can be said with the bass hook around Michael Jackson's Billie Jean, the bass line is ""smokin"" vocals are up front the driving rhythms beat stands stout.  From my experience, to get the most out of the Bose Sounddock 10 recordings need to be CD quality or close to wring the most out of the Sounddock 10's capabilities.Best","01 1, 2012",Bose Sounddock 10 redux,1325376000,Electronics

It was the only live document of Purple with Bolin at the time. What a disappointment. I don't think this was much more than a final shot to capitalize on the Deep Purple brand. Seems to have been edited and mixed haphazardly. Bolin's playing is below par, especially on the Purple classics. If Purple had not had such a huge back catalog, this band could have survived on the new material. While an extremely talented guitarist, Bolin was not a good replacement for Blackmore.

"I am generally speaking a buff of foreign and indie movies, and when I saw this in the foreign movie section at my local library, I picked it up, knowing very little about the movie. I must say I was unprepared for what I was about to watch.""When We Leave"" (terrible movie title; originally titled in German ""Die Fremde"" or ""The Alien""; originally releases in 2010; 119 min.) brings the story of a Turlish married woman getting out of a domestic abusive relationship. She takes her young son and moves back to Germany, where the rest of her family is (Turkish immigrants in Berlin). You might think that seeking help from her family would be a good move, but you might be wrong. Because she is considered to ""belong"" to her husband, no matter what, she brings dishonor on her own family. Things get from bat to worse: she is beaten, harrassed, threatened, etc. Not to mention that her son is also deemed to ""belong"" to his father, and so she needs to protect him from being kidnapped BY HER OWN PARENTS AND SIBLINGS. With family like that, who needs enemies?

"Gregory Peck plays a magazine writer who is asked to write a series of articles on anti-Semitism.  He struggles to find an angle that hasn't been done before, then realizes the only way he can write it is to live it first.  He pretends to be Jewish and encounters some outspoken biased feelings from some, and even worse a politeness from others who smugly hide their prejudices but still restrict hom from joining others.  This sudden ""truth"" about him affects his relationship with the woman he loves...and his happy son is suddenly picked on by classmates who call him derogatory Jewish slurs.It is still a powerful piece, though dated, of course.  But prejudice still exists for people of all nationalities and religions.  We've seen enough of that in the news to know that hate never disappears.  Gregory Peck is excellent as the writer, and Dorothy McGuire turns in a good performance.  Exceptional in the cast are John Garfield as the writer's best friend (who happens to be Jewish), Anne Revere as Peck's mother, and Celeste Holm, who develops a crush on him.  Garfield is best known for his angry young man performances, but except for one brief moment of a fight in this film, he displays a touching inner dignity throughout the picture.  Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap) is excellent as Peck's son.The film was a difficult one to get made.  It was a best-selling novel, but most of the studio heads wouldn't option the screen rights because they were Jewish and they didn't want to draw attention to themselves by making this story.  Maverick producer Darryl F. Zanuck, who wasn't Jewish, was the head of the 20th Century-Fox studio at the time, bought the rights.  And after it was filmed, the other studio heads offered to buy the film from him, in order to shelve it.  He wouldn't sell out...and the film went on to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1947.Many of the people in front of the cameras and behind had to face the House Un-American Activities Committee.  John Garfield died a few years later of a heart attack due to the hounding by HUAC.Video quality is exceptional, with definite grain.Audio is also good.Extras are carried over from the DVD:  A Hollywood Backstory about the making of the movie (25 min.), a trailer, two Movietone clips, and a dry-as-dust commentary by Richard Schickel with tiny bits interjected with film stars Cleste Holm and June Havoc.Highly recommended.","01 26, 2013",Best Picture winner of 1947 is still excellent,1359158400,MovieTV

The acting performance of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet was Fantastic, the love story was Mesmerizing, and the music was just the icing on the cake that blended well.

The characters were all unique in their specific roles and the emotional roller-coaster ride was one a viewer will never forget.

"I purchased this mouse to replace my aging Razer Diamondback. Even though the Razer is large I still tend to use it in a somewhat claw style. I had tried the Logitech G9x and found its shape and feel not quite to my liking and the middle mouse button way too firm (I use it a lot for working in a UNIX environment).The CM Storm Spawn is similar in size to the Logitech but seems a bit more natural in my hand. The buttons are well placed and respond well, the scroll wheel is easily pushed (no side scrolling here to throw you off either), and I appreciate the ring finger rest. I like that this mouse is smaller and much lighter than the Razer. That is good for making fast, precise movements with minimal effort.The newer firmware releases do not seem to play well with my setup so I have been using the original. Lift-off distance seems a bit high in that but I don't tend to lift my mouse anyway, so this was not that big of a deal to me.I wish there were more options for DPI than just the three settings.

"Everyone once in a while one of those video cards come out that can overclock like mad and hit much above what it's supposed to..At stock 7850 is actually pretty weak for a $250 card considering its next-gen. It's better than the somewhat cheaper geforce 560Ti but not by much. And it's slightly slower than 570. To make things worse it's not really much better than the previous gen Radeon 6950.But the thing is amd has deliberately underclocked the 7850. That is because clock for clock the 7850 is only about 5% slower than the 7870. And the 7870 is a $300+ card. Surely, they couldn't allow the 7850 to have the higher 7870 clocks.Here's the deal if you overclock this card it would pretty much lay to waste most video cards this side of the gtx580. And here's why:1. 7850 scales VERY linearly with clock. That means if you overclock by 20% your real-world performance in games jumps by 20%.2. 1050mhz (22% overclock) is pretty much guaranteed. There's not a single 7850 on the internet that couldn't do 1050 mhz.3. I got one of the bad samples and ended up with a ""bad"" overclock of 1100 mhz 24/7 stable. Along with memory over clocks, i get 25-30% increase in frame rates compared to stock.4. At those speeds the 7850 sails past the 570 and gives the 580 a run for its money. Its just unfair to compare it to the 560 Ti now.A lot (but NOT all) of cards hit 1200 mhz. Beyond that the scaling is less linear. From 1200 mhz you'll only get a few fps for a huge increase in temps/power.Simply put overclocked this really is the best video card at $250. If you don't you're throwing your money away. And there's no reason why you shouldn't.If you're not overclocking you're missing out on 30% FREE performance.

"""Brazil"" is the second feature film by Terry Gilliam, of Monty Python fame.  If you're familiar with Gilliam's extremely off-the-wall animated sequences from his work with the Monty Python Group, and/or have seen his first feature-length film (Time Bandits, from 1981) then you might be able to imagine what sprouts from his creative consciousness in his second full-length film.Starring Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Michael Palin, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, and Ian Holm, ""Brazil"" is a sci-fi fantasy and black comedy that defies clear explanation (just as you might expect from Gilliam); rife with visuals and creative lunacies that amuse, fascinate, and horrify.Bryce stars as Sam Lowry, a bureaucrat in a futuristic world, whose boring life changes after his lovelorn daydreams of a woman he's never met draw him unwittingly into an increasingly surreal world that, since the making of the film over 25 years ago, foreshadows a possible future for us all.","11 19, 2011",surreal and disturbing,1321660800,MovieTV

"This could be one of the worse cases I have purchased. The last good product I received from Ringke was the Slim for the Galaxy Nexus. After that, there haven't been any cases that fit properly. The case for the Note 2 was loose around the sides and this case is the exact same, or possibly even worse.The trend to make cases as thin as possible is creating some very poorly fitting cases. The case I received for my GS4 was packaged well, in the typical eco packaging that Ringke has adopted. After opening it, I immediately was disappointed. The case was a very thin material that was very soft and pliable. I worried about the case fitting properly and it was justified when I put the case around my phone. The volume and power buttons have absolutely no tactile feel to them. They are just mushy, inaccurate buttons that don't do much. I can barely press the volume down button without pressing very hard; so hard that I'm worried that I am going to break the phone. The case doesn't stay snug on the phone either. It is separated from the volume buttons so far that you can see the silver trim around the sides.The only way I would ever buy another product from Ringke is if they used more rigid material in their designs. The current super soft, super thin TPU that companies have gone to is doing nothing but making the product bad. The case I use the most is my UAG case because it is rigid, the buttons have good feedback to them, and it stays in place. The fusion case is easily pulled from the sides of the device. Overall I am highly unsatisfied with this product and don't think I could recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well fitting case.","07 20, 2013",Terrible fitment,1374278400,CellPhone

"Metal-core is a genre not well-tolerated by the general public, and for good reason. With such descriptive words such as ""chaotic,"" ""brutal,"" ""pounding,"" and ""assaulting"" used to describe the vast majority of the overfilled genre's artists, it's no wonder that it's a rather acquired taste. August Burns Red is likely one of the least accessible; there's no pop music influence at all here. However, the technical prowess and creativity that the band displays draws immediate comparison to the talents of even classical masterminds like Franz Liszt and Fredric Chopin.Don't misunderstand me - no one is going to mistake August Burns Red for a group of classical artists. The music is ear-splitting and hard-hitting, but ""chaotic"" they are not. The mathematical quality of the rhythms and riffs juxtaposed with pleasantly understated harmonies make the forceful nature of ABR's music an extremely complicated listen - but one most certainly worth your time. One thing that makes this album even more complex is, ironically, its tasteful use of simplicity. There is a softer side of ABR displayed here in small doses, making its way especially into ""Internal Cannon"" and ""Carpe Diem"" and less noticeably into a few other songs. Some hardcore fans may be initially put off by this, but it allows drummer Matt Greiner to add a level of nuance and subtlety not common within the genre to his already masterful rhythms. ABR is usually not repetitive, with many of their songs moving forward as if it were one rambling flow of musical thoughts rather than a cohesive whole, but certain musical motifs are repeated throughout songs in ""Leveler"" in order to provide a distinctive flavor to each. Indeed, the perceived chaos of the music is only attributable to relentlessly creative structuring, from the Spanish guitar of ""Internal Cannon,"" to the almost ""Thunderstruck""-like guitar melodies of ""Cutting the Ties,"" to the upbeat harmonies of ""Salt & Light,"" to the amazing final moments of ""Leveler.""There are few complaints I may lodge against this work. Still, I view artistic perfection as something unattainable, and ""Leveler"" has a series of very minor missteps that keep it from being absolutely flawless. Firstly, it peaks too early, with arguably the most masterful song, ""Internal Cannon,"" clocking in as merely the second track. Secondly, guitar phrasing during solos is often a little too straight-timing for it's own good. However, I nitpick, only because this highest echelon of music deserves the highest constructive criticisms.The tightness and coherent nature of ABR's latest certainly gives it a personality unlike all else. Are there more technically skilled bands out there? Absolutely. Are there more melodic bands out there? Absolutely. Does anybody else mesh those qualities so seamlessly into a work of musical art? Not likely. Some people will eat this right up, some people will find it almost revolting, and still others will adamantly refuse to grant the genre any praise for its musical innovation. However, if you have the stomach for it, ""Leveler"" is at the very top of the hardcore heap. Unless August Burns Red or someone else manages to top it, consider this album the magnum opus of the heaviest metal, destined to be studied by musicians in meticulous detail decades from now. Definitely worth a listen, even if this isn't your cup of tea. If it is, then there's no reason you should pass this one up.Ten-point Scale: 9.5 out of 10Genre: Hardcore / Heavy Metal / Progressive MetalObjectionable Content: Mild Language (used in correct contexts)Recommended: Highly","07 1, 2011",Truly Impressive Artwork,1309478400,CDVinyl
"Dolph Lundgren is Major Max Gatling hired to rescue a big company&#8217;s daughter named Jude (Melanie Zanetti), who is trapped inside an unnamed South East Asian city quarantined because of viral outbreak. Most residents have turned into zombies there, but the major is determined to find the girl.Shot on location in Johor Baru, Malaysia, &#8220;Battle of the Damned&#8221; starts out promisingly, making good use of the existing buildings and streets. The action (mostly guns and knives) are not particularly impressive, but as a low-budget action movie it is acceptable.About thirty minutes in, however, the story gets stuck. This often happens in zombie movies when characters hold out in a building (like a house or shopping mall). Filmmakers need some trick to keep us interested, but unfortunately, in &#8220;Battle of the Damned&#8221; nothing really interesting happens in the next thirty minute.But, despite the numerous flaws, there is one thing you will not forget. It is robots (made in Tokyo). Don&#8217;t ask me why they are there. The effects (CGI and practical) are cheap.

"For the most part I have really been enjoying Black Ops II, but it should be said that I'm not currently doing the Multiplayer portion, and if you're someone who's buying this game solely for that you should probably read the many Multiplayer-centric reviews here because there have been some serious issues with the game.  For me I'm enjoying the Single Player Campaign and looking forward to seeing how far I can climb in the now-ubiquitous Zombies portion.  I've played every game in the Call of Duty series and with luck will continue to enjoy them.The original Call of Duty:  Black Ops took place during the Vietnam War. Black Ops II takes the story from the original Black Ops and carries it forward in more ways than one:  the story is told through flashbacks that carry you through missions at the tail end of the Vietnam War, then into the late '80s as the Cold War started to end, and also in our near future, a 2025 that is very real and believable because technology we have or are about to have is integrated into the gameplay.  While you don't have to know much about the events of the first game to understand the story, it does help to do so and I enjoy the way they take the storyline forward.Graphically, Black Ops II is only a bit cleaner than Black Ops, but that's not much of a criticism given that the first Black Ops game looks really good on the XBox 360.  There is a smoothness to the play that seems to make it easier to move through, though at times the way the camera takes over to create a more 'cinematic' moment can be off-putting--such as when you tumble down a hillside or get caught by surprise to forward the storyline.  Fewer of these moments actually require you to do anything, so they're more spectacle than they are quicktime event.Gameplay of Black Ops II is fun and intricate because of some additions.  You can customize the loadout you take into a level.  There are 'Strike Force' missions that put you in more of a tactical position:  you play the objective flipping between a map-level view where you give orders to your allies, and diving directly into a soldier or device.  The interesting part is that Strike Force missions give you a certain number of 'teams' to try the mission and your success or failure drives the Single-Player Campaign.  This means that you story can go different ways with different playthroughs.Unfortunately, there are some problems that leave me feeling the same way I did in World at War, when I seemed to perpetually die pointlessly at random choke-points and have to do something stupid to get out of it.  Some of the markers you need to go past to progress the mission actually require you to physically tag them for no reason.  I had a level where I was doing a great job helping my team advance by flanking up one side and going around, but the hotspot was in the dead center of a clearing covered in enemy crossfire.  There was no reason for me to go there, such as an object to pick up or a switch to flip, etc.; but until I ran out in that clearing and tagged that dot, we couldn't go forward and enemies just kept spawning.  There is a mission where I'm supposed to avoid a drone and nothing I did seemed to work until I ignored my squad leader's orders, hid in a corner, and waited for him to get to the checkpoint before me.  I'm smart enough to move quietly and hide in shadows by now--this was one of those moments when I wondered how they could possibly have playtested that piece.  Shortly after that, I'm instructed to go prone...and the 'go prone' button simplly doesn't work...unless I stand in a specific spot.  Despite there being no obstacles or 'can't go prone here' warning, it doesn't fit the perfect happy path of the designers.These combined with some AI stupidity in the Strike Force missions are the drawbacks to the game.  Since I've seen that other players do well with Strike Force, the issue may just be that practice makes perfect.  In the meantime I plan on enjoying Black Ops II again and again:  the fact that it flashes forward through time makes it a lot more fun.","12 13, 2012",Flashing Forward,1355356800,VideoGames

"This late in the review game, there's already enough reviews on picture quality, usage, etc. Here's my opinion based on coming from a 5N, with experience owning Canon gear.The jump from the 5N to the 6 is pretty much like going from the Rebel line (t2i, t3i etc) to the 50D or 60D... huge step in build quality, minor upgrades though in image quality. The 6 feels like a pro-grade camera, and the 5N feels like a toy now. Nice, sturdy, heavy feel (may be a downside to some who need it as light as possible), and great grip for shooting photos and videos.I use a 5DMK2 for professional use, and originally bought the Nex-5N for travelling. I had a T2i initially for travel, but it was still too bulky. I fell in love with the nex 5N's small body, and great quality lenses. Naturally, being used to full body canons, i got a little frustrated with the 5N's touchscreen controls, and missed a wheel for quick adjustments. I would sometimes lose the shot searching through menu's, and the control wheel of the 5N was a lot more flimsy, causing you to screw up every so working on the controls when rushing adjustments. The 6 is has tougher controls and quicker to set... much more satisfying for the one that knows how to use it.Also regarding the more sturdy pro-like body, it feels like I can even take it on one of my photo shoots. Maybe I will and see if a client cares.Anyways, that's my input. Some side things:-I'm a fan of micro-usb charging. One less thing to carry when travelling light. Yes a small plastic piece is a big deal, especially when backpacking across the amazon. I don't have to dig around my pack just to charge batteries, nor do I have to worry about losing a charger (which would screw me on a trip). I can charge it through a external battery, which I already own, on the fly without an outlet (on a bus or plane). Also, all my other electronics charge off micro usb, so no extra cable to bring (only exception is my GoPro, but mini-usb is close enough). If it's a big deal, Wasabi (that's the brand) sells spare batteries that work as good as the original, and it comes with an external charger. Even better, I bought that wasabi kit for my 5N and they are they work perfectly for the 6.Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Sony NP-FW50 and Sony Alpha 7, a7, Alpha 7R, a7R, Alpha a3000, Alpha a5000, Alpha a6000, NEX-3, NEX-3N, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-5R, NEX-5T, NEX-6, NEX-7, NEX-C3, NEX-F3, SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A37, SLT-A55V, Cyber...-It's bigger than the 5N, but not so much. Considering I also had the external flash always installed on my 5N, the ""area"" it takes up isn't that much bigger. Plus, the pancake lense makes up for it, and feels much sturdier than the original 18-55mm.-Built in flash can be pointed straight up. Those who know the advantages of that, will understand why thats a pro. You can't set it to that position, but you can hold it pointed up by keeping your finger on the spring.-wifi functions is an advantage i wasn't shopping for originally, but glad i have it now. works perfectly on my galaxy s5, and can instantly upload photos without a laptop, on the fly.","05 6, 2014",Review from a nex-5N to this Nex 6 (also Canon user),1399334400,Electronics

"Goodfellas is such a good movie that I wish I could rate it than 5 stars.  Since Amazon only goes up to 5 stars I'll have to settle for only 5 stars. This movies is a classic and is not only a great crime thiller but also a great movie under any genre.  Goodfellas features the amazing acting of Robert Deniro.Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family through the eyes of a Lucchese associate, Henry Hill. The movie covers the period of time from 1955 to 1980. The movie features the great acting of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino. Goodfellas was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor (Joe Pesci, who won).I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review.","12 6, 2013",GoodFellas is a classic,1386288000,MovieTV

"So i got this in the mail yesterday and its works like a dream! I have both chromecast and this Roku stick and i gotta say. I dont think i'll be using chromecast anymore.The roku stick has everything i need built in incuding netflix, amazon instant video, hulu, youtube, PLEX etc etc.having a amazon video app alone is worth the price of purchase. its a shame chromecst doest have one.Also the PLEX app interface is great. The 2 things that i thought chromecast had over this was casting plex and youtube from phone only to find out that Roku can cast too!Finally, the range. for whatever reason, when i cast plex from my phone to chromecast the video always stops every few minutes. I'm guessing becasue of the range from the chromecast to my wifi router? Well this Roku stick streams my plex movies from 2 floors away from my wifi router with no skips or buffering at all! The loading of the movies may take a few seconds but once its running, it doesnt freeze.

"I hate Apple. But i somehow got convinced to buy a Nano anyway so I could use the Nike+ features with my music instead of having 2 devices.The first one I bought the headphone jack broke after 1 use. It wouldn't accept headphones anymore they would just slide right out.Ok, I was pissed but I had just spent a year putting s*** on it and now I had to bring it back to Best Buy within a week. I bought it while on vacation in GA and then got the second one in WA where I live.  So there is no chance that the GA store had a bad batch or something. The second one I got after 2 months of very light use is having similar problems.It turns off randomly based on how the headphones are positioned. If they twist a little too much it just turns off. So the music turns off pretty much anytime you move if you are holding it or have it in a pocket. I pretty much can only use it if I'm sitting down and the ipod is not touching anything at all and is sitting flat on a table, like an obnoxious princess.Now I'm going to have to dump everything off it again and bring it to the Apple store to have it fixed.  I want to throw it in the trash but the stupid thing was so freaking overpriced that I don't have the heart.Going back to my previous policy of not buying any overpriced bull from Apple.","05 21, 2014",Space Grey Model must have problems.,1400630400,Electronics

Though regardless the smurfs and the variety of the situations they found themselves in always and still entertain me to this day.  Like the first season part one set this set has mostly twenty ten minute episodes though some are the standard twenty minutes(Technically a full thirty minute show without the commercials),  The series stays mostly light with some episodes trying to address some basic issues but with a lighter touch such as lying/Greed/Slothfulness but not to dramatically to push away kids or make parents concerned to much.  The series is and will remain a classic for myself my family and friends who grew up with the series and hopefully many growing children who watch the show as well,  and while you won't get your Pokeman battles or Yugioh card battles in the series it still will entertain any child who sees the series much to their amazement I'm sure....","07 30, 2011",Love The Smurfs In General But Stopping At The First Season,1311984000,MovieTV

"As mentioned in other reviews, this is a combo animated/live-action film about Easter.  EB, the ""heir"" to the Easter Bunny throne, runs away from home to follow his dreams of playing drums professionally.  He ultimately ends up with Fred O'Hare (played by James Marsden), who is a dreamer who doesn't fit into any job and is being forced to find work by his family.  Mayhem ensues, with EB defecating jelly beans and basically making life havoc for Fred.  After misadventures at a video game company and a run-in with a famous talent-searcher, Fred and EB end up saving Easter from the diabolical chick assistant Carlos (and finding their own dreams and friendship after all).First of all, the film is absolutely gorgeous.  The scenes of the Easter Factory are beautiful -- some of the most wonderfully animated settings I have seen.  The studio does a great job of fitting EB and other characters into the real world, down to shots normally missed such as shadows and reflections.The voice and live acting are pretty good, with Russell Brand performing as EB. James Marsden interacts well with the animated characters as well.On the downside, for most of the film it is almost impossible to find interest or care for the characters.  EB is a spoiled child who does everything he wants to wreck other lives, and Fred is a dreamer who tries to deal with the wreckage.  It's kind of unfortunate that you can't find empathy for either child, both of whom are trying to please their fathers but failing.  Finally by the last 15 minutes of the movie you find that EB and Fred can compromise, work together, and reach their dreams while reconciling with their families.  But if you can't make it through the first 3/4's (most of which involves making humorous messes and some potty humor) of the movie to that point, you probably won't really care about the ending.","04 26, 2012",Cotton Candy: Sweet but ultimately not very satisfying,1335398400,MovieTV

"I rented this movie because the 4- and 5-star ratings outnumbered the 1-star ratings by a ratio of 20-1 (201 to 10). I agree *completely* with all ten of my predecessors' 1-star ratings.Aside from the Cromwells, the acting is miserably bad. The storyline is more predictable than a Mighty Mouse cartoon and the entire ""interplay"" between the nurse and patient is acted so badly it not only *feels* contrived, it almost comes off as being read from cue cards.Fortunately, I like James Cromwell, and just enough to sit through this travesty to enjoy his performance. Unfortunately, I had to grind through Jonathan Bennett and that nurse. He should stick to the lightweight-movie roles for which he's ""known"".This movie almost set a record for the number of times I looked at my watch. Everyone touting this movie makes claims for heart-felt this and that... BS. Without James Cromwell, I'd wager most of the audience would vanish... Bennett scenes ground time to a crawl. The most touching scene had nothing to do with the scars of war and memories of military service, nor anything related to the movie title. That ""most touching"" scene was performed when Cromwell thanked his wife for his last lemonade--again, the emotional strength and impact of the big screen was only wielded by Cromwell's talent.If you're suckered into watching this garbage despite having read these reviews, ask yourself one question while you're viewing the movie--""do I care what happens to this character?"" It'll tell you if you think there's any viable performance by the subject you're watching. I'll bet your answer is, ""no""... and if it is, skip the rest of the movie. Nothing happens that you didn't anticipate, and everything you'd predict comes to pass. There's a reason the IMDB rating for this movie was 5.6--I wish I'd seen their rating before renting this movie. Without the pre-29yr old female vote, the IMDB number would have been remarkably lower.If you feel the need to watch a well-acted, or patriotic, or heart-felt, or handkerchief movie about how vets feel when they come home from war, do yourself a BIG favor--skip this and rent ""Coming Home"" or ""Born On the Fourth of July"".Zardoz, make room; you've got company.","08 25, 2013",suckered by preceding reviews,1377388800,MovieTV

"~ This 2-disc set has everything I look for in a documentary.  It is informative, honest, and entertaining.~ The directors / producers Robbie Cavolina and Ian McCrudden have interviewed not only Anita O'Day, but they have also interviewed numerous people who have known her throughout her career.  The combination of interviews gives a complete picture of Anita O'Day.  Thankfully Cavolina & McCrudden decided to make this documentary while Anita was still alive.  Their extensive interviews with Anita reveal an honest, open person who has lived through considerable tragedy and survived with a strength of character and attitude that is inspirational.~ So many documentaries seem to have a mission: either to deify the subject or to vilify the subject.  To achieve the desired goal, those documentaries downplay certain facts and over emphasize others.  However, in this documentary nothing is sugar-coated and nothing is hidden. Anita, Cavolina & McCrudden lay it all out for the viewer, and in the end you may not agree with the way Anita lived her life but you have to respect her honesty and her indestructible spirit.  She never lived in the past, she rolled with the punches, picked herself up, dusted herself off, and moved forward.~ Cavolina & McCrudden have done a nice job of presenting a chronology without making the documentary a simple history lesson.  They do this by interspersing interviews and performance videos.~ The first DVD contains the documentary.  The second DVD contains interview out-takes and more complete performance videos.  All of this is worth viewing and I am glad they included the second DVD.  Some of the performances are from Anita's exceptional performance inJazz on a Summer's Dayand the entertaining videosJazz Icons: Anita O'Day Live in '63 & '70andLive in Tokyo '63.~ The DVDs are packaged with a 30 page booklet that is a welcome addition and worth reading.~ This documentary serves as an excellent companion to Anita's autobiographyHigh Times Hard Times~ Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about one of the jazz greats.","03 4, 2012","Informative, Honest, and Entertaining",1330819200,MovieTV

"This Fire Emblem compared to the Tellius series is weak in comparison. Given this game is a remake of the first Fire Emblem, it's justified, but the problem with this game is mainly the fact that they didn't change anything from the original.Gameplay: The gameplay is the same as other previous Fire Emblem games only in this game you can have units change classes if you don't like the one they have. It's very handy but not useless more times than not.Graphics: I found the graphics rather uncanny. I feel like this because there is hardly any new character emotion sprite. In other games, characters had sprites that showed their emotion when they were neutral, angry, sad, etc. Here, they only have one face and it doesn't seem to work well at all. When Marth is sad, he doesn't look sad and it takes away from the story (that is the same from the first game so nothing much was changed).Difficulty: The game I feel is much easier than other Fire Emblem games if only because there is an arena that you can abuse to level up. You can die in the arena but just quit if you think you are. The save feature was nerfed to only two saves given how in Radiant Dawn people abused the save feature so they wouldn't be RNG screwed.The thing that made me feel like the game lost me was the support system. In Radiant Dawn, the support system was horrible because there was no character build up and it was just used to pair up people with the best element (earth + earth for example). Here, there is none. True the original didn't have a support conversation but given how the west doesn't know much about the characters in this game unless they're major characters, it defeats the purpose of having so many units that you don't understand.Overall, this game is disappointing for a Fire Emblem game. I would pick up one of the other games instead of this. Does not mean this game can't be fun or challenging. I just found it disappointing.","02 24, 2013",An Average Fire Emblem Game,1361664000,VideoGames

"Hot on the heels of theirPerry Mason Mysteries: The Original Warner Bros. Moviescollection comes the PHILO VANCE MURDER CASE MYSTERIES COLLECTION.  During the '20s and '30s, the undisputed leading light of popular American detective fiction was S.S. Van Dine's Philo Vance. The brilliant and often overweening Manhattan sophisticate appeared in a dozen best-selling adventures that became coveted properties for the Hollywood studios, as Paramount, Warner and M.G.M.. jockeyed for the rights. The six black & white films (on three discs) spanning the decade from 1930 to 1940 feature a variety of Vance portrayals, and a variety of styles along with a variety of film conditions.  In my summaries I try not to give away the plots, but there are some minor spoilers, so use your own judgement. Let's investigate......The first selection, THE BISHOP MURDER CASE (1930) from M.G.M. stars a dapper pencil mustached Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes) as the titular detective.  The only other ""names"" in the film are Roland Young (RUGGLES OF RED GAP, TOPPER) and Leila Hyams (FREAKS,ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, RUGGLES OF RED GAP).  The print quality is watchable, but suffers from speckling, damage and a constantly crackling soundtrack.  Like many movies of the early sound era it seems framed more like a stage play, probably due to the limitations of the early sound equipment. Rathbone hues closely to S. S. Van Dine's descriptions in the original novels, a brilliant dilettante dandy, only with the moustache replacing the monocle. There's a great scene near the beginning where we see Vance having breakfast on his Art Deco balcony, sitting in his Art Deco chair at his Art Deco table.  The supporting cast reminds one of a amateur theatre production, stiff delivery, over-acting and all.  Even the leads flub a line or two, I guess there was no money in the budget for re-takes!  The case revolves around a number of murders inspired by nursery rhymes (the first victim's name is actually ""Cock"" Robin!), committed by a murderer calling himself ""The Bishop.""  All the usual characters abound, the old woman who knows more than she lets on, her nervous hunchbacked brother, the old professor with a pretty niece and her fiance, etc., etc.  Really creaky, but worth it to see a young Basil Rathbone at the start of his career, and for all those great wool suits......Next up is THE KENNEL MURDER CASE (1933), a Warner Bros. release starring the ALWAYS dapper William Powell (THE THIN MAN SERIES, MY MAN GODFREY, MR. ROBERTS) on his third go-round, having already portrayed Vance in two films for Paramount, THE GREENE MURDER CASE (1929) and THE BENSON MURDER CASE (1930).  Co-starring are Mary Astor (THE MALTESE FALCON, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), and Eugene Pallette (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, THE MARK OF ZORRO) on HIS third appearance as police Detective Sgt. Heath.  The film was also directed by the great Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA, MILDRED PIERCE, WHITE CHRISTMAS) whose touch elevates this entry greatly. Look for a great traveling crane shot near the end. The plot concerns one of those door-locked-from-the-inside murders of a miserly rich guy that everyone wants to kill.  A second murder is also discovered. There's no shortage of suspects, the niece ""under his thumb,"" her lover who thinks the victim may have killed his dog, the ex-con butler, his shifty personal secretary, the two-timing girlfriend (in a dress with fringed shoulders that you have to see to believe),her lover who also has a motive, and the wronged Chinese cook.  Vance owns a scotch terrier, Captain MacTavish, and there's a scene with a dog that could be Asta.  The movie has a few slyly humorous scenes, especially those involving the grumpy coroner played by actor Etienne Girardot, who repeats the role twice more later in the series.  The picture quality is a tad better, with good contrast, but still full of speckles and scratches.  Thankfully the sound is fine and strong, as is this entry in the series......My fave, Warren William (LADY FOR A DAY, THE WOLF MAN) portrays the sleuth in 1934's THE DRAGON MURDER CASE, this time a First National entry.  Besides the retuning Pallette and Giradot, the cast includes Margaret Lindsey (THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES, THE ELLERY QUEEN SERIES), Lyle Talbot (GO WEST YOUNG MAN, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE), Robert McWade on his second go-round as D.A. Markham and Etienne Girardot returning as Coroner Doremus.  The dragon of the title is actually a ""dragon pool,"" a deep, dark pool that is rumored to be home to a water monster.  During a party, three guests go for a swim and, you've guessed it, our victim, again not very well-liked, doesn't come back up.  The pool is later drained but no body is found, just the tracks of a three toed creature!  Of course Vance, D.A. Markham and Sgt. Heath know better, and try to winnow down the suspect pool (sorry!) after another guest is found dead.  The shady group this time includes a reluctant fiance in love with someone else (are there any other kind in these movies?), her true love, her drunk brother, her ""mental case"" mother, the victims's old flame, and the prerequisite butler.  The picture and sound are similar to the previous entry. William played Vance one more time, in 1939's you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-itThe Gracie Allen Murder Case.  He was born to play these debonair roles, having just finished his first appearance of four as Perry Mason, he would go on to play Michael Laynard ""The Lone Wolf"" in seven pictures for Columbia between 1939 and 1943.  Three are available on DVD,The Lone Wolf Meets A Lady(1940),Counter-Espionage(1942) andPassport To Suez(1943).  Warren William passed away of cancer in 1948 at the young age of 53.  Fortunately his films are being re-discoverd and re-released, and you can catch many on T.C.M. from time to time......Our fourth entry, from M.G.M. is THE CASINO MURDER CASE, a faithful adaptation from 1935 with Paul Lukas (DODSWORTH, THE LADY VANISHES) as Vance.  His co-stars included Rosalind Russell (THE WOMEN, HIS GIRL FRIDAY), Eric Blore (SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE LONE WOLF SERIES) as Vance's butler, THREE STOOGES discoverer Ted Healy (MAD LOVE, SAN FRANCISCO) as Sgt. Heath, and in smaller roles; William Demerest (HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, MY THREE SONS) as an auctioneer and Leo (G.) Carroll (SPELLBOUND, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E) as a butler.  Charles Sellon takes over the role of Dr. Doremus the coroner. The picture quality is similar to the last two, and the soundtrack, directed by Douglas Shearer is great. The plot revolves around anonymous notes sent to Vance warning him about future murders.  The first victim-to-be is familiar to Vance, so he uses a ruse to visit the subject's home and finds the family arguing; the subject's there with his estranged wife, his wealthy mother, the butler and mother's secretary (Russell), who takes a liking to the cultured Vance.  The feeling is mutual so he invites her out, but first takes her to see the D.A. and shows her the note.  She's able to tell them where it was typed, so Vance and Sgt. Heath start to investigate.  Even though warned, the victim goes to his uncle's casino and collapses after taking a drink.  At the same time the secretary informs Vance that the victim's wife has also died at the mansion.  The resulting investigation has it all, family secrets, changed wills, books on poison, false confessions, decoys, more secrets and even another murder.  As you might gather, the plot is more dense and complicated than the former entries.  The cast does a good job and the director keeps the action and plots moving. Paul Lukas makes for a different take on Vance, but his  manner and soothing Hungarian accent fits the character like a glove......The fifth tale is M.G.M.'s THE GARDEN MURDER CASE from 1936. This time Vance is portrayed by Edmund Lowe (WHAT PRICE GLORY, DINNER AT EIGHT) along with Virginia Bruce (JANE EYRE, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD), Gene Lockhart (MEET JOHN DOE, HANGMEN ALSO DIE!), Grant Mitchell (MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER) as Markham, and the great Nat Pendleton (PENTHOUSE, BUCK PRIVATES) as the preening Sgt. Heath, providing comic relief from time to time. Etienne Girardot makes his third and last appearance as meal-deprived coroner Dr. Doremus. For the first time a trailer's included, and it's overall condition is better than the feature, but the film's picture, after a rough beginning, improves greatly and is the best transfer yet compared to the other entries (but that's not saying much). In this entry, Vance joins a millionaire and his guests in his box at a steeplechase race for ""gentlemen"" riders. Also attending are his estranged ward who's also his niece, an older Major with his younger wife and the rich man's friend, who's about to race.  The amateur jockey seems to be in a trance, and when the Major's wife implores him not to race he can only answer that he's going ""to fall, break my neck.""  As any mystery fan could guess, this is exactly what happens. It's initially considered a suicide, but Vance has his doubts.  At a party at the millionaire's house the next day, Vance finds out about all the rattling family skeletons.  The millionaire's niece hates him because he and her grandmother are trying to break up her romance with a young man by offering him a job far, far away, which he accepted, putting a strain on THEIR relationship.  Mr. Moneybags was also ""having it off"" with his mother's nurse, but has dumped her, which will result in deportation to her native country, England. This understandably has put her in a bind.  There are also rumors about the dead jockey's affair with (  ). But a shot and a scream are heard that night, and our rich friend is found dead.  And that's just the start of the fun!  Lowe's performance as Vance is more contemporary and this time his dog is a dachshund. As the series progresses, the portrayals of Vance and his mannerisms get farther and farther away from the novel's descriptions......Our final program is Warner Bros./First National's CALLING PHILO VANCE from 1940. This time British-born James Stephenson (KING OF THE UNDERWORLD, THE LETTER) answers the call for Vance.  His co-stars included Margot Stevenson (INVISIBLE STRIPES, RABBIT RUN), Edward Brophy (FREAKS, MAD LOVE), Henry O'Neill (WELLS FARGO, WHITE CARGO) as D.A. Markham, Jimmy Conlon (a Preston Sturges regular) as Coroner Doremus, and look quick for George Reeves (GONE WITH THE WIND, SUPERMAN). CALLING PHILO VANCE was adapted from THE KENNEL MURDER CASE, and is almost a scene by scene remake of the superior earlier picture, but still has it's own charms.  Set during the beginning of World War II, the dog show introduction of the earlier film is replaced with a prologue showing Vance trying to retrieve a set of airplane blueprints Vienna.  The government suspects that prominent airplane manufacturer Archer Coe sold them to the enemy, but Vance unfortunately loses the proof. After some excitement we are back in the U.S., when Vance and Markham, who now works for the Secret Service, receive news about Coe's murder.  From there on the plot development matches the previous movie so closely that I can't believe it was written by different people. Stephenson (who was a Best Supporting Actor nominee for THE LETTER), with his debonair British accent and urbane wit, is a breath of fresh air portraying a somewhat more traditional Vance. Heath is now called Ryan, but the characters are interchangeable. Coroner Doremus and Captain MacTavish are also back, with the scottie almost stealing the picture.  The pacing is faster than KENNEL which moves it along nicely, but the denouement feels rushed. A trailer is included, but the picture quality of both are a step down from the previous film......The movies weren't done with Vance yet, 1947 saw three more pictures released, PHILO VANCE RETURNS starring William Wright, PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE, and PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION, both with Alan Curtis. All were from ""Poverty Row"" studios PRC and Eagle-Lion, and their plots and portrayal of Vance bore little resemblance to the character of the novels.","03 6, 2013","""A Variety Of PHILO VANCE's Escape The Warner Archive......""",1362528000,MovieTV
"Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5"" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of ""armor,"" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are ""stuffed"" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.","05 18, 2013",Best Windows Phone as of early 2013,1368835200,CellPhone

"My dad had this system a couple years and it successfully protected several investmenet properties that thieves tried to break into and steal the copper while they were under renovation.  He was able to easily move the system from property to property with ease and set it up.After hearing friends recent stories of break-ins, I decided to try SimpliSafe as well.  The system is extremely simple to set up and the instructions couldn't be clearer.  The base even gives voice prompts when testing the system or programming the key fob.  The sensors are simple to affix to any wall and door and they are sturdy.  The only issue I has was one exterior was inset too far into the frame for the sensor on the frame to detect the magnet affixed to the actual door.  So I had to superglue an extra cheap miniblind bracket that I had on the door to bring the magnet further out from the door.  Works perfect and looks good.  The fact that the battery in each sensor lasts 3-5 years is also  great.  I recently ordered the fire/smoke sensor because my insurance discount will pay for almost half the alarm system if I include that sensor.My only complaint would be that text/e-mail alerts should be included in the $14.99 plan, instead of charging an extra $5.00 for it.  It would see to be a simple and cheap addittional service to provide at no additional cost to the customer.

"Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian, May 20, 1946) needs no introduction; she is one of those rare icons for whom a single name alone conjures up not just her image but also her incredible style, personality and sincere warmth whenever she performs. This two CD set may not have every last one of her very best hits but I am very impressed nonetheless; as others note we get such jewels as ""Alfie;"" ""You Better Sit Down Kids;"" ""Living in a House Divided"" and the extended version of ""Take Me Home.""All the way through both discs, the quality of the sound is excellent. The songs are presented in chronological order which lets us hear for ourselves just how well Cher's voice held up over time--indeed, since she began recording in the 1960s Cher has been able to belt out a tune and yet deliver it with such sensitivity it makes her rendition the definitive one! It's incredible to read in the liner notes just how many people Cher has collaborated with.I would mention highlights but there are really no duds in the track set here.

"Regina Spektor's last album, 2009'sFar, found the singer-songwriter at her most accessible.  This move seemed to put off long-time fans; Spektor's appeal before finding her way to VH1 was her offkilter songwriting.  With WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS, Spektor has returned to the fun, strange songwriting that initially brought her into the spotlight.  This album was produced by Mike Elizondo (who also worked on FAR): perhaps most well known for taking Fiona Apple's EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and giving it a streamlined and focused spin.WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS is hard to predict.  Not only do songs range in tempo, tone, and mood from one song to the next, these shifts can happen mid-song (notably in the album opener ""Small Town Moon."")  Listeners can, however, expect the impulse-driven piano pop that mixes blends of genre, nonsense, and convention.  The changes in style never feel like Spektor is aping a genre or playing the chameleon; instead, it feels as if Spektor's imagination is running wild in the studio.  The result is an interesting, fun album.The opening ""Small Town Moon"" begins as a conventional piano pop song, but it soon gives way to typical Spektor mannerisms (starts, stops, repetition, etc...) before ultimately opening up into a stomping chant of ""Everybody not so nice, nice.""  It's hard to really describe it, but it's great fun to experience.  ""Oh Marcello"" is similar in its unpredictability, ranging from wild falsettos to beatboxing from Spektor.  This is followed by ""Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas),"" a song that incorporates hints of tropical music with horns and a Russian chorus.  Not all of the songs on the album are quite so wild; ""Firewood"" is a simple, soulful song composed Spektor's piano and a drumset -- it makes for one of the most inspired passes of Spektor's lyricism.  The only real problem I have with CHEAP SEATS is that it feels scattershot.  Some of the songs feel less developed than others (compare ""All the Rowboats"" to ""Ballad of a Politician,"" for example).  While the album gets a strong start, the Beatles-esque closer, ""Jessica"" doesn't quite feel like a good way to wrap up the album.Recommended sampling: ""Small Town Moon,"" ""All the Rowboats,"" and ""Oh Marcello"".  Fans ofFiona AppleandFeistwill probably find a lot to like here.  If you like any of Spektor's previous releases, this album is worth you time and money.ADDITIONAL RELEASE INFO:  A deluxe edition of WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS was released.  If contains three songs that didn't make it onto the album.  These songs are:Call Them Brothers (feat. Only Son),Old Jacket (Stariy Pidjak), andThe Prayer Of Franois Villon (Molitva).  These songs are good, but ""Call Them Brothers"" rises above the rest and is definitely worth seeking out.  The other two are covers of Russian songs; they feature Spektor alone with her piano.","05 29, 2012",A Great Return to Form!,1338249600,CDVinyl

"I've tried about 6 different brands of screen protectors on various phones and I'm happy with this one.As far as quality goes, I think PowerSupportUSA products are probably the best I've used (but they are only made for apple products and they cost $25 each).I also tried a Skinomi protector for my Nexus 4 which I HATED. The material is wavy and gross (you can see ripples all over the screen and the back glass) and it didn't feel good to touch. I highly recommend you stay away from it.As far as this Tech Armor goes, the fit is pretty good (unfortunately since the Nexus 4 has curved edges, it is impossible to have a screen protector made of the harder (more clear) plastics fit all the way to the edge because the curve does not allow the product to sit flush. So this product covers the entire FLAT part of the screen but doesn't go all the way to any of the edges of the actual glass. It does not obstruct the front facing camera or speakers. I kinda wish it at least went all the way up to the top and bottom (but it doesn't). Woulda have given it 5 stars if it did.It is a fantastic price for 3 screens (in case they get damaged or you totally screw up the install).I have also used this product on two iPhone 4's and it fit very very well and my father and friend are happy with it.All in all, if you want a good screen protector for your nexus 4, I recommend this one.***UPDATE*** If you install the screen protector close enough to the top, it will COVER the proximity sensors on the upper left corner of the phone which will make it impossible to use the phone once you make a call. Make SURE you either install it low enough to avoid covering the sensors or CUT OUT a small piece of the top left corner so you don't obstruct the sensors!","12 19, 2012",very clear product.

"Saw this CD reviewed in an issue of Alternative Press about fifteen years ago. I wanted to check it out - but for the life of me - I couldn't remember the name of the band or it's title. So here - fairly recent, I stumbled across 'Philosophy Of The World' on Amazon merely by chance. As it is, I vaguely remember this trio of sisters. The Shaggs were a collective of siblings Betty, Helen and Dorothy Wiggin. Tunes I thought were worth mentioning include the worthy title track &#34;Philosophy Of The World&#34;, the quirky &#34;My Pal Foot Foot&#34;, &#34;I'm So Happy When You're Near&#34; and the just plain - dumb &#34;Things I Wonder&#34;. Not sure, but The Shaggs might actually have two compilation CD's out as this is their sole proper lp initially put out in 1969. 'Philosophy Of The World' is one of those Avant Garde / obscure pop titles that are honestly -so- bad that it's actually halfway entertainingly good. Should appeal to similar artists that show up on the couple of Arf Arf sampler CD's that I've seen out there. Overall, not a bad pick.","05 1, 2014",Shaggs - 'Philosophy Of The World' (SBME),1398902400,CDVinyl
"What's in the box?CaseInstructions in the caseSetupThe instructions were in the box.  It was not exactly intuitive to disassemble the case.  If the same thing happens to you, then follow this:The stand clip must be removed first.  Peel it from the back and pull it away.Remove the front plate.  Lift the edges from the case and peel it away.Next remove the rubber bumpers.ConstructionRubber bumpers are strategically placed on corners to minimize damage.  The back of the case has a rubber reinforcement, also, to decrease absorb shock.  The screen stand works in landscape mode only.There is a light and thin plastic cover.  Along the edges of the screen, it is less sensitive to the touch.  I tried a leak test using this in a steam shower.  It failed miserably. The screen became wet and it became virtually insensitive for the touch screen to work.  I disassembled the case and wiped down the case and screen.

"I bought these here. They came in two days. Very satisfactory.I had a Creative 4.1 system. It sounded fine but there were too many wires. Four speakers on my desk and sub woofer at my feet was just too much, especially since my den is also my Home Theater. I have a big 5.1 system installed in this same room. If I need to hear something big - like the Ring - I will listen to it on that system not on my computer speakers.So I tossed my Creative system and bought a small inexpensive Logitech set of speakers. I bought them here too. But alas I decided to get the USB version. They worked fine. Extremely easy to set up, and no extra wires. The only defect was that the USB speakers couldn''t play loud enough. My ears aren't too good anyway, so soft speakers are not a good fit for me.These Altecs are conventional in that they get their signal through the stereo mini phone plug not through the USB connection. I believe that with USB connections the power amplifier in the speaker. In a conventional speaker set like the Altecs there is separate power cord and plug whereas with USB there is no need for a power cord. The USB cable supplies the power. However it can't transmit much power so the amp in the speaker can't be very powerful. All this means that USB powered speakers will always be limited in volume.I wish someone had told me all this.In any case these speakers are plenty loud. They look good and they sound good.

"This is it! With every Step Up movie that comes out, it just gets better and better! This movie really could be its own movie and doesn't really need to connect with the first two movies. But still, it does connect in a way. In the last two movies, the main story was about a troubled young adult star that goes to a performing art school for high school. Then, through dance, he/she learns to have a better life and has a bring future.In this movie there is more depth with the story. It's about a guy named Luke. He finds and leads a group of talented dancers to become a family of dancers all with their own unique style of dance. All these dancers want to make it big as dancers, but have no where to go to do that until Luke comes and lead them. Another new dancer that Luke finds is Moose and he is a return actor from Step Up 2. Moose doesn't know what he wants to do about dance because he is actually going to school as an engineering major. He then decides to join the group. Another dancer in the grop is Natalie. There a whole plot story with her but I don't want to spolier it for you and won't tell what that is. There still another of other things that I haven't talked about the movie yet, but instead you should watch it and enjoy it.In this movie you will hear amazing music, and see hot dance moves!

"My old iPhone car charger broke and I needed a new one. I saw this PowerBolt Duo and I like the fact that it will charge our iPhones, iPods, and our iPad 2. That is because it has the capability to charge at 2.1 amps which is a requirement for the iPad 2 and 3 and it has a second port that output 1 amp that is ideal for my Apple iPhone. You can use it on your iPhone and iPad at the same time.I like the fact that the device has an LED that indicates that it is getting power and that it is low profile so it doesn't take up a lot of space and it is not easy to bump. I also like that charger cable that goes to your Apple device has a standard USB connector on the end that plugs into the car charger plug. This means that you can use the cable that came with your Apple device if you need to.  It does come with an Apple 30 pin connector cable that unplugs and I can plug in my Apple iPad Air lightning cable and charge it also.One disadvantage that may sound silly is one that I also mentioned as an advantage.

"I HATED THIS MOVIE and I really expected to like it, especially after seeing Heavenly Creatures, King Kong and the LOTR movies, I figured that this would be yet another fantastic film from Uber Director Peter Jackson....Eh, not so much. This movie is TERRIBLE, it's LOUD and it is ANNOYING. The film starts off OK, I bought the premise that Michael J. Fox's character could (SPOILER ALERT) see ghosts and even work with them to scam people with his Ghost-Busters type spirit removal service, but The Frighteners very quickly falls apart after the first 30 minutes. Fox's character is a scam artist, and he bumbles and stumbles WAY too much to be taken as a real person. I really can't stand it when movie makers try to make a Comedy/Horror film, for me, the two genres just don't belong in the same film. Look, either make me laugh or give me a fright, but don't try to do both because it doesn't work and I just end up feeling manipulated. Jeffrey Coombs scatter-brained FBI Agent character is the most irritating character in movie history, next to Robin Williams in the equally bad film Toys. By the time this POS was reaching the lame climax, I actually thought about hitting the eject button, but I wanted to see if Jackson was going to go for the obvious, predictable ending, and he did! In the future, whenever I hear someone talk about a film that has fantastic special effects, but still sucks, I will think of The Frighteners.","08 3, 2013","Not good, not good AT ALL...

As I said before, the Apple product is still a better product, but at this low price, this makes a great second keyboard. I'm now a happy customer.*** Original Review ***I was looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard to use with my iPad, since I need to leave my Apple keyboard at home with my Mac Mini.Out of the box, this keyboard was just as expected. From the top, it looks like the Apple wireless keyboard (it's clearly an Apple knockoff), but made from inexpensive plastic. So far, it seemed perfect for my needs.After putting in batteries and turning it on, I've found that it just won't connect to either my new iPad (i.e. iPad 3) or my Mac Mini (running OSX 10.7). I followed the simple instructions that came with the keyboard (and everything I could find by searching Google), but nothing worked.Funny, the Mac could see it, but said there was an incompatibility that kept it from connecting. The directions indicate that you should get a code to type into the keyboard to pair it (and I got this when connecting my Apple keyboard), but it never provided a code for connecting this knockoff keyboard.If others hadn't had better luck with this keyboard, I might have thought it was that Apple was rejecting non-Apple equipment.

Like with the previous three movie versions of the RE franchise you'll have the main character Alice kicking A$$ and taking names from the most recent boss threat which this time is neither Wesker or a mutated human/monster hybrid but something that is connected to the beginning movie.  While it's enjoyable to see that they brought in two more iconic game RE characters(Ada/Leon) overall the fight and action scenes while enjoyable also feel so repetitive of those from the mentioned previous three movies from before, also while not a big impact on the movie we are introduced to a few other characters from the earlier RE movies as well.

"This is, without any question, late-1960s production values.  In this day and age, there was none of the multi-tracking that Queen later applied to Bohemian Rhapsody--instead of having 96 tracks to work with, people of this day had only recently been blessed with more than one.  So on tracks such as &#34;You Got Me Floating,&#34; the &#34;mind-blowing studio effects&#34; can seem gloriously like canned goods.  And the auditory and lyrical fashion of the times ring out as garishly as Hendrix's clothing fashions did. But God, is it pure.

But Hendrix was never calculating in a careless, phoned-in sort of way.  He wanted to go deep.  Here, he does.  &#34;If Six Was Nine&#34; is the best example of this, I suppose.  It recalls the Doors' &#34;The End,&#34; or &#34;When the Music's Over,&#34; in the way it draws you in for a think, and illustrates it with all these musical flourishes.  The guitar can't be critiqued, because it's all been said; the incredible, wiry Mitch Mitchell gives the same sort of staccato, strobe-effect snare blasts that the Doors' John Densmore did; and Noel Redding's bass cannonballs marvelously into the pool, like Hurley from Lost belly-flopping from a high-dive.  The songs bridge the gap between the first album's 2:50 pop, and Electric Ladyland's experiments.

"Just adding my 2 cents. I guess you could say I have been waiting since I was 12 to see (Picture o.k.) and hear one of the best dubbing jobs ever done on a Godzilla movie. No luck here. As a long time film collector, I immediately noticed the audio problem. The film was too loose on the sound drum, so it slipped and wavered. This caused that horrible and amazingly distracting problem. WOW! how UN-professional can a company get?

"This seems like a solid Z77 board for this price and from a big name.  I was unfortunate enough to get one with bent LGA socket pins.  I was frustrated and started the return process before I wondered if I might be able to fix it.  With a magnifying glass and a spudger, I was able to bend the pins back to an acceptable range!  I only recommend this for the very steady of hand.Anyway, I loaded this up with 8GB of 1600 RAM and an i5 3470 and it quickly posted.  This is when I did a little dance because of the successful pin repair.  Before bothering with an OS, I easily flashed the newest UEFI BIOS, which is quite nice.  Pretty good features and a nice layout.This board posts FAST and loads Windows 8 in a split second (SSD, of course).  I built this PC for a friend of mine and she more than once missed the restart process because it happened so fast.  Geekbench scores were in the high 12,000's to low 13,000's.  Very nice, and similar (or better) scores to my Sandy Bridge i7 machine from a couple years ago and MUCH less money spent on this machine.Overall, this is a really nice entry level Z77 board.

"The first thing to grab my attention with this router was it's ease of initial setup and use for the novice user (aka my mom, or others who use the internet, but aren't very computer/network knowledgeable). As I delved into the router interface further, I then noticed the depth of advanced settings and controls that would please just about anyone that has the knowledge/desire to delve that far into a router configuration.Setup is a quick five-step process, and hits all the basics to provide a WPA2 protected, open broadcast wireless network. I have high amounts of confidence that even my mom could take this out of the box to operational status quickly, without need for help. The router does come with a pre-configured/default network name and WPA2 passkey, and the setup will prompt to change these if desired. Another nice feature for the novice user is the included network information card that comes with the pre-configured network info, plus enough space to write down any customized changes made during setup.Once setup, I jumped into the router web interface to do further configuration and look at advanced options. The interface is well designed - unlike many of my home router/gateway experiences in the past, the interface is clean and consistent, well organized, and even seems to have a fully developed help system (most others always seem half-baked and missing good information). Everything you'd want for fine control is here and quite detailed, even the option for a guest network on each band. One setting I'd recommend to avoid is the captcha option on the router login page - this only provides for frustration when you want to login due to (at least my own) inability to properly identify look-a-like characters used in the picture. After multiple attempts for each login, I quickly disabled this feature (it's not enabled by default).The device itself deserves kudos - it's a sleek, simple, aesthetic design. The front of the device has two lights - power and internet connectivity. The rear has the network ports and the power button (large enough to find and use without having to turn the device around), and a single USB port for attached storage. Space between all the ports is adequate to ensure the USB device and five network cables could be plugged in at the same time without fighting for space, however, the USB port is at the top of the device, which may cause problems with USB drives that tend to have short cables. I would have preferred the USB port to be near the bottom instead.All in all, this is a well designed and thought out device. I would still recommend this router to my friends/family who aren't very computer/network savvy, as well as recommend that those who are network savvy should take a serious look at it.Pros:Easy setupExcellent web interfaceAdvanced configuration optionsDesignCompatible with current/legacy wireless devices""future proofed"" (for a little while at least) with A/C capabilityCons:USB port locationcaptcha difficulty","07 15, 2013",Impressive router for both novice and advanced users,1373846400,Electronics

"Jonah Hill plays a character (Noan) in this film. The first scene depicts him having oral sex with a woman. The movie degrades from there if you can believe it. It is 80 minutes of sexual situations, drunks, buying illegal drugs, stealing cars, car wrecks, foul language, stealing gifts from kids, shoplifting, guns, street fights and dragging the children that he is responsible for through all of this. Through all of this we also have to watch this loser (Noah) give life counseling to a young actor playing a 13 year old who is gay.This movie is one tasteless scene after another. It ranges from peeing on the floor to police officers stealing drugs and jewelry from the suspected criminal. This movie has no redeeming value and is simply one predictable and disgusting scene from beginning to end.This is just another Hollywood movie with clich&eacute;s on gays and racial discrimination.

"This is not my first mechanical keyboard. I've been using a Unicomp Model M buckling spring keyboard for several years--it's probably the loudest and heaviest keyboard out there, great if you're a key pounder and work in a room alone. I was looking for something quieter with a lighter action (actuation of the Model M is something like 60g; the QuickFire is more like 45g--much lighter and easier on my arthritic joints).I've had it for two days and I'm loving it. I'm a writer, I spend all day typing, and I can say I feel very comfortable with it. It's fully backlit, a feature I can do without, but it does improve visibility at night. I can't get over how smooth and clean the keys feel. I remember keyboards like this many years ago, where typing was a quiet dance with the fingers, very little motion. I feel that rhythm returning. The Cherry MX Brown switches are just perfect, giving a subtle and quiet tactile &#34;bump&#34; at the actuation point.The keyboard is very well made, solid, heavy, and the braided cable promises to last forever. It's got rubberized feet, which means it stays put. I'm very happy with my purchase.","11 3, 2013","Writer friendly, quiet mechanical keyboard is a win",1383436800,VideoGames
"Using this to switch between Wii console (with new HDMI adapter) and blu ray player. Worked as soon as connected- without a power supply, which if needed you'll have to order separately.Unit auto switches depending on which device is powered on but remote also works. I will probably remove IR sensor to get less clutter.Update 3/11/14: I have downgraded this item due to a problem that occurred while trying to play my Blu Ray player. Connecting and switching was easy but when I tried to play a DVD in my player it produced screen image interference in the form of snow that switched on and off, making viewing the DVD impossible. I disconnected the switch and connected the player directly to the TV and the picture interference went away. Can only assume the switch was the problem.I have emailed Portta to see if they can resolve this issue and will report back.Update 3/12/14: Portta was very quick to respond - almost immediately. They said my picture interference problem was not enough power from Blu Ray to maintain switched position and that I needed a 5v power supply to correct. The power supply is free but the shipping is about $4.50 usd. The sellers description did not mention the possible need for a power supply and the price certainly does not reflect one. The scant product instructions say no power supply needed (on standard product). I assume that to get the IR remote working you'll need a power supply - for now the unit switches automatically.This is no way to sell a product. At least include all the information so a better buying decision can be made. I have revised my rating to 3 stars from 2 but this is for the lack of purchase information and proper manual. Amazon did their usual great resolution job with their customer first policy and I got a refund of about what the power supply would cost which meant I did not have to return product.Edit: 3/18/2014 It is pretty much impossible to deal with the manufacturer in China. I have tried to order the power supply to get this switch to work but they are so inept at english I cannot make them understand I have sent payment. If you can find another switch from a different supplier I would recommend that. Because of this I have reduce rating stars to two.Edit: 3/18/14 I finally received the power supply from the manufacturer. The switch works great with a power supply. I have upgraded the rating to 3 Stars. It should get 4 or 5 Stars but the hassle I went through to get it working properly reduced the rating. The problem was mostly due to poor information from the seller, not the supplier, about the need for a power supply.Edit: 7/7/14 Switch didn't work long even with purchased power supply. Started blinking the picture as the switch would not hold the switched position. It actually gave me problems a few months ago but I hesitated this review update until I confirmed the switch was bad. Got my money back from Amazon but never was able to get the refund on the power supply I had to purchase from Portta. I have reduced the rating to one star.

"Fantastically refreshing movie that my daughter and I loved, loved, loved! I was surprised by how much the story of Elsa and Anna and how the whole movie was about their relationship, rather than around a romance. There were a couple of scenes where I thought, oh no, it&#8217;s going to be a romantic love story in the vein of Cinderella, love at first sight, etc. But thankfully, Disney turned that on its head and I didn&#8217;t have to worry about my daughter getting any wildly unrealistic notions of true love because of this movie.I also love the underlying message of embracing one&#8217;s self and turning doubt and insecurity into strength - a theme that is stirringly evident in &#8220;Let it Go.&#8221; My daughter loves this song and I do too.

"I bought this case for my new Garmin GPSmap 62s. While it may just look like a rubber covering in the picture, it is a hard shell case covered with rubber on the outside. Here's my overall impression.PROS:1.) VERY durable and well made. The construction on this is top notch.2.) Fits my GPS 62s like a glove. The unit doesn't move around inside the case at all.3.) When attached causes the GPS screen to be recessed which would help protect it during a drop.4.) Made in the USA!5.) Included lanyard is handy to secure the unit and keep it from being dropped...though with this case I wouldn't be too worried if I did drop it.CONS:1.) Adds a good bit of bulk to the unit. Fits like a glove, but a very thick one!2.) Not super heavy but the extra weight is noticeable.2.) The only two ways to connect this to yourself is with either the lanyard or the metal belt clip. If you just use the lanyard it flops around as you walk which is irritating. The belt clip makes it secure, but if you're like me and are constantly removing your GPS it is annoying to reattach (plus will leave a wear mark on most materials after constant use). They should have made the belt clip a quick-release type.None of the CONS are huge, but I included them to be thorough. I am confident this case WILL protect my GPS unit, which to me is the most important thing. To make it perfect I think they need to work on reducing the bulk and make a ""quick-release"" option for mounting.","05 17, 2012",Tough and rugged case,1337212800,Electronics
"NOTE: Though I am NOT happy, I will NOT include any SPOILERS!!I am notifying all who care that I am sincerely thinking of giving up this series.There are times that great fiction -- which should of course be prone to the ""rules"" of life on this planet -- must present the negative side of life: tragedy included.But there are times that works of fiction deliberately manipulate emotions in what I consider to be an ATTENTION-GETTING END-OF-SEASON RATINGS MANEUVER, and this thoroughly ticks me off.I will not discuss the events that characterized the last few episodes of this season, but I will say this: ENOUGH ALREADY, DOWNTON ABBEY!As the thousands of people who have supplied Amazon ratings have attested, this has been until recently a delightful series that immersed us not only in the aristocratic lifestyle of the privileged, but also explored the matters that concerned those that served them.In addition, DA also clothed itself in turn-of-the-century historical themes that characterized the era, letting us see the impact of major events like the Great War as well as the equally powerful influences as influenza, the proliferation of telephones and the rise of Women's Suffrage.In this manner the series remained topical and true to the era.But toward the end of this season I have begun to feel manipulated through contrived rating-grabbers, and it has really made me question whether I want to continue watching this series.I know that ratings matter, and it's important that a public TV station gain influence on those with deep pockets and pocketbooks, but I'm just about done with the sensationalized events of late.Why not an earthquake that swallows the town?  Why not have John Bates run away to become a barnstorming pilot?  Why not have Lady Grantham swept away by an alluring Sheik of Araby?Right!

"...but not as gritty as I remembered it.  I saw this film several times in the first few years after it came out and enjoyed it immensely each time.  I bought the Blu-ray because the price was right  (I already owned the DVD but hadn't watched it in perhaps a decade).I guess after years of watching superlative crime dramas like ""The Wire"" and ""The Shield"", ""An Innocent Man"" now seems a bit tame and under-written by comparison.  That should not, however, be too much of a criticism.  For what it is, ""An Innocent Man"" is well done, well acted, and done with earnestness.  I was a much younger and less cynical person when I first watched this movie, and it was perfect for its day.  I don't think it holds up as well as I would have wanted it to, but that's due more to my evolving tastes than the to the content of the movie.Aside from a few choice words here and there, this could almost be a TV movie (albeit a very good one).The Blu-ray transfer is very good.

"The Incipio Dual Pro is a dual layer case that protects your iPhone 5 well (several low level drops have resulted in nothing but my heart leaping),giving a raised front and back that absorbs shock and protects your screen well.  It doesn't interfere with operation (although the keyboard letters on the sides require you to adjust your hand a bit to use) or the camera.  The problem is that the Incipio Dual Pro's coating wears off pretty easily, resulting in ugly black banding around the sides of the case.  It doesn't really impede operation, but it looks rather unsightly.Recommended for people who want a rugged case at a decent price.","12 26, 2012","Great protection, not so great finish",1356480000,CellPhone

"I love this headphone for its ingenious design and long battery life.  The main body of the headphone rest on your neck and is very easy to conceal under a shirt or sweater.  The only thing visible is the wires and the ear plug.  This makes it very discrete, not at all geeky.  Because of the substantial size, it is able to house a 10-hr plus battery.  I can go on a short business trip without bringing the charger.Design aside, the sound quality is nothing to write home about.  It is about the same quality as the headphone that comes with the iPhone.  I guess that's not bad for a BT headset.  Not much base at all.  Many earlier reviewers complained about the range.  LG might have fixed it.  Mine does not have that problem at all.

"Actually, I accidentally ran upon one of these at Wally World and earlier, a Phillips that played AVIs.  I bought the Phillips without realizing it played *.avi files at first, but then one day I got an avi file, popped it in and VOILA!  Later I spot this machine on clearance in Walter World.  I buy it because it plays mkvs, avis, mp4s, WMS files,all the international files.  See what's great is that you can turn a secam or Pal or US HDMI or NTSC file or disk to one anyone can watch anywhere, by using the internationally accepted digital formats devised mostly by non-business amateurs mostly, shared over the internet worldwide.  Once in awhile I'm looking at an American film that has embossed (unremoveable) portugese subtitles, because the file came from Portugal or Brazil.  And they're all watchable on this player, the BD-D5100 Blu Ray Disc player.  It has one drawback.  The remote won't open the drawer to the disk player.  I assume that's why it ran into sales problems.  The reason the function is missing is certainly that it traded off the open function for some of the functions that go with the territory of selecting different files to play.  These players are not alone.  Many HDMI sets in the states will play USB flash or thumb drives laced with many or all of these same file types.  This is a valuable video player for someone wandering off the dopey cable/satellite/network/tvstation conventional programming path. I wonder when Americans are going to realize the programmed stuff is just chaff, pablum and kitsch.","10 2, 2013","A Player To Access Video Material That Is Not Chaff, Pablum & Kitsch!",1380672000,Electronics

"I was so excited to get Beats By Dre.  I kind of bought them impulsively after someone told me they were supposed to be amazing and really popular, and I should have looked on the reviews here first....because two words: TOTAL GARBAGE.Okay, maybe not total, but for $300?  Heck yes....worse than garbage.  I don't even know the word for it.  First of all, for $300 you think you'd get some noise canceling and there wouldn't be too much sound leakage, right?  Wrong.  My boyfriend was constantly complaining about these headphones and how he could hear every single word, even if it the volume was low.  It made me too embarrassed to even wear them in public.  And as far as canceling noise?  Not really...you can still hear most things around you and won't do anything for you on an airplane.Also, there was a really loud crackling noise in my right bud when I turned them on right out of the box.  Sometimes it would go away, but it was super annoying, and for THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR HEADPHONES you don't expect a crackle at all.  My $5 headphone that I found in Target's bargain bin had less issues than these headphones.The fact that you have to use batteries is just pointless.  There's no auto-off feature in case you forget to turn them off (which is easy to do), and then suddenly the headphones will die on a road trip.The only thing these headphones have going for them is that they look really nice (although they feel a bit cheap and plasticky) and are very comfortable.  I also like being able to push down the right bud to mute it.  But for $300 this is a total scam and rip-off.  I returned and exchanged forSkullcandy Aviator Headphones w/Mic3, $100 cheaper, and wow - so much better.  Noise canceling, no sound leakage...the whole deal.  Maybe not quite as comfortable, but you don't have to worry about a stupid battery and the fact that everyone around you can hear your music.These headphones are maybe worth $50 at the most.  $300?  Please.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","10 9, 2012",Is this a joke?  Seriously?,1349740800,Electronics

As one reviewer wrote, I kept waiting for the movie to pick-up, to get better, but it just left you hanging with this empty feeling of 'is that all there is'? The movie never takes the approach that she is going to get better mentally, emotionally, or that she even understands her own short comings. I had anticipated (or hoped for)some humor, but there turned out to be none. Don't waste you money buying or renting this one!

"I pretty particular about my music and the sound quality of my speakers.  I wanted a bluetooth speaker that I could take outside for the patio or to the beach, something that could give me sound volume without sacrificing sound quality.  I initially went with the UE Mini Boom after reading the 5 star reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was a good speaker, but there was absolutely no bass.  It was super clear, assertive, great for vocals or acoustic music.  I even bought two of them so I could separate them for stereo but the stereo app was problematic and the signal kept dropping so I shipped them back.  I then went to Costco because someone told me they had the &#34;bigger&#34; Soundlink on sale.  I listened to it and wasn't impressed.  The bass was there but everything sounded muddy, like a boombox from the 80's.  I then realized it was the Soundlink II, not the latest version.  There are plenty of reviews of the Soundlink II versus the Mini and the Mini seemed to win out so I bought it, paired it, and listened.The Soundlink Mini is nothing short of impressive.  Clear vocals, incredible bass, plenty of volume.  I put on some jazz, Dave Brubeck, and the cymbals were clear and the snare drum attack was sharp.  The acoustic bass was full and rich.  It made no sense. that a speaker of this size was producing this sound.  Next up was Steely Dan.  Reeling in the Years popped with the electric guitar and when the drums and bass came in it was stunningly satisfying.  I went through my collection and everything from 60's rock to acoustic coffee shop female vocals passed the test.  I would imagine that today's bass heavy music would be equally satisfying.The build quality is excellent and sophisticated, like something that should be in a museum for design.  It linked up easy and stayed connected as I walked around, an experience I did not get the the UE Mini Boom which would drop signal if I held my iPad Mini in the wrong place and blocked the signal.  In fact the only thing I would say as a negative is that this is such a nice unit that I don't think I would take it to the beach without having a cover or something on it.  And if it drops it's probably dented versus the UE which is rubberized.  But those are very minor things.Why not the Soundlink III?  Yes, it was impressive and probably a bit deeper in the bass.  But it's such a large unit that I doubt I would take it anywhere.  Plus, and I know this is a bit geeky, part of the magic of having a cool speaker is to have a tiny speaker put out such amazing sound.  The III is large enough that it BETTER sound great, whereas the Mini will have people cocking their heads like a cocker spaniel and wondering how such a small speaker puts out such great sound.I tootally recommend this speaker.  It could even become your main speaker in your home (if you don't mind not having true stereo) - that's how good this speaker sounds.","06 22, 2014",Why I Went With the Bose Mini,1403395200,Electronics

"I really like this DVD of The Phantom of the Opera.  I usually have some difficulty with live shows for a few reasons:  before the use of individual microphones, I would have difficulty hearing dialog or understanding lyrics; being too far from the stage makes it difficult to appreciate facial expressions and acting.  Also, I tend to feel the mood of music before registering the lyrics.  This DVD remedies these difficulties.  The production itself as well as the performers are excellent.  The camerawork allows for close ups (facial expressions, dialog, acting, details of dance and costume) and the distance views allow for greater appreciation of the corps de ballet and other wider scenes, angles one would not have live.  For the most part, the editing and flow between different camera angles is well done.  Subtitles (or the libretto I saved from my LPs) enhance the storyline by making clear the dialog and lyrics when needed.  One criticism is the uneven volume: the opening fanfare (Universal Studios logo) is very loud; the following dialog is extremely soft, as if individual microphones were not used; the following Overture is loud again and blasted me out of my seat after having turned the volume up for the Prologue.  The first 30 minutes were spent experimenting with settings on my DVD player and TV to get the right balance without having to constantly adjust the volume.  Act II seems to be more even in volume, perhaps because there's less dialog and more continuous music.  (The dialog in the final scene was again inaudible at the lower volume setting.)  (Other DVDs of musicals and this show on PBS did not have this problem.)  It would have been nice to have some production notes included, similar to a Playbill.  I also would like to see this production on a large screen.I recently purchased Les Miserables, the 10th Anniversary DVD (concert style) and previously, Camelot at the Winter Garden (which was filmed for HBO in the 1980s).  I really do like this format.  It's like bringing the show home.  After years of listening to the recordings and closing my eyes to remember the visual, I have both again.

"Its always fun for me when proficient musicians who are stuck in a genre step out and try and get their groove on.  Usually, most diehard metal fans (which I am definitely one), whine that their favorite musicians are ""selling out"" for money, or ""giving in"" or some such nonsense.  Personally, I think its awesome that musicians as wonderful as this try and cross over from the inbred world of hardcore metal into a more commercial sound so they can actually feed their families, and maybe not live in their parents basements until their 50s.Bands like Delain, Unsun, and many others have formed from the pieces of hardcore metal to produce melodic crunchy themed music, with killer musicianship and almost pop like vocals and themes, and I for one, love it. Its fun, plain and simple, and every single record I buy can't be an epic journey into the depths of suffering generic metal.Amaranthe is basically perfectly produced crossover glam metal thats poppy and punchy.  Its like the wine you buy that your mother can drink, without you having to tell her about all the amazing subtleties you learned at some lame wine tasting.  Just drink it for goodness sake....Nexus is a little more spotty than their first release, with the same formulaic 3-4 minutes songs (sized for radio play anyone!).  There are 3 vocalists that front this band, growl, clean male, and clean female, and it all works.  The choruses are very big and catchy tunes, very accessible for the normal person.  Some of the songs on this album feel like Disney channel pop dancing songs (Razorblade), while other are tough and hard and very Euro Metal.But all in all, this album is less a poke in the eye than their first album, but its still great. The vocal work is absolutely awesome, and works on all levels.  The musicianship and production values are, for lack of a better word, perfect...  you may not like the melodies, but the technical proficiency is flawless.

Hate, gratuitous violence, no REAL heroes, celebration of the anti-hero, hopelessness, rape, pillage and mass-murder.  All the women were whores and all the men were cowards, crooks, rapists or drunkards.  I was particularly offended by the depiction of the Mexicans; had black Americans been portrayed in that manner back then, the movie would have been banned or theaters burnt to the ground.  Never the less, after 44 years, I decided to give it a second chance -- it seemed worse now than it did back then!About the only redeeming factor of this farce-on-film were the beautiful stark landscapes and the train robbery scene (cool-looking steam locomotive). The acting was one-dimensional with a cornball script.  Robert Ryan and William Holden had seen better days and were near the end of their careers by the late 60's.  Ernie Borgnine tried to put on a professional face but seemed too embarrassed at having to utter the pathetically little inane lines he was given in this picture; most of his acting was reduced to nothing more than a set of facial expressions -- what a waste of talent.I remember, at the time, many major theaters refused to show the film due to its violence and brief scenes of semi-nudity (bare-breasted Mexican women but not white women), but it did quite well at the low-end drive-in theaters (remember those?).","06 12, 2013",It Wasn't A Western At All!,1370995200,MovieTV
"I bought 16GB of Crucial memory for this baby based on the helpful reviews here in Amazon. I found the memory sticks a bit difficult to engage in the connectors and I feared forcing anything. I have installed memory in laptops before with no difficulty. The top memory was most difficult and the mini was seeing only 8 GB. I watched an instructional video on YouTube and the installation looked so easy, so I tried again. Finally I found the angle for the dangle and the memory slipped in and pins were engaged, obviously. So, it was probably just my installation skills. Now, with 16GB, this thing screams and the overhead - heavy games my boys play have not effected the blazing speed. (they did with the PC this Mini replaces).  I have had trouble with my PCs losing connection to my wireless Brother printer, however, the Mac Mini  found the printer, installed software, and connected right up. The Mac just works.

"Power banks have become pretty much a commodity item, with many different vendors offering them. They all pretty much work the same (e.g., store up a charge and then allow you to use that to recharge a device) with the distinguishing features really coming down to aesthetics and, of course, capacity.This power bank does a good job on both fronts. It's rated at 10,400mAh. While I can't verify that quantitatively, it seems to be pretty accurate, as it was able to bring my Fire and phone to full charge without running out of juice.Design-wise this is one of the more attractive power banks I've used. The body is white plastic with black edging. It sort of looks like a large flip phone folded up. The plastic is high quality and feels substantial.It has a 4 light system to serve as a battery gas gauge. There are 2 5v USB output ports, each rated at 2A. I especially like that it has a built-in micro USB cable that stores neatly alongside the edge of the case. It is on the short side, however, measuring 4 inches from base to tip.The power bank itself is pretty compact, measuring about 3 inches by 4.25 inches and an inch thick. The edges are beveled to help make it seem smaller than it is. It weighs 8.5 ounces. Not lightweight, but quite good considering it's 10,000+ mAh capacity.It comes with an assortment of adapters as listed in the product specs. It does NOT include a wall charger adapter, nor does it include features such as a flashlight or a carry bag. But, it's also priced pretty well, so I'd rather have a lower price than features that don't directly impact usage as a power bank.There are only a couple of misses. I would have liked to see at least one of the output ports rated at 2.1A, and a longer built-in cable. But those aside, it's a nice power bank.

"I had no intention of ever watching this series. It seemed to me like a Twilight-type show, only extended for hour upon hour. There's only so much teenage-angst and emo-drama I can stomach, so I had no plans to see it. And then, I got sick, and my sister grabbed the first season from the library with the intention of making me watch it. So, with protests and misgivings aplenty, I started watching.The first two discs or so confirmed what I believed the series would be...and then, something amazing happened. They dropped the emo-drama, and focused on actual story. And, instead of watching it because I had nothing better to do, I found that I really liked the series.To be fair, the first episodes necessarily had to be slower...we were ""meeting"" the characters and learning about their lives. That wasn't the problem. It was the predictable-and-oh-so-annoying back and forth of the main character, Elana, deciding she and her vampire boyfriend, Steffan, can't be together because he's a monster, then changing her mind only to find that he's decided they can't be together because he's a monster, before he changes his mind...etc., that was truly aggravating. Yes, I know it happens in the vampire stories, from True Blood to Twilight...but, for once, I'd like to see one where it didn't! That, and all the silly drama that went with it, was what I found really annoying about the first two or so discs. After that, though, the story really seemed to find its way, and became very enjoyable.The characters, especially after the first two discs, are really pretty likable - or, at least, understandable; the story is very interesting, and progresses (after the first two discs) at a good pace. The townspeople and history the series creates are very well done, and believable. You feel like you ""know"" Mystic Falls and its inhabitants after awhile.All in all, I give this 5/5 stars...because it redeemed itself from the emo-self-pity-party pattern that it had fallen into in such a superb way. Now, looking forward to season 2!","06 20, 2011",Sure that I wouldn't like it...and ended up loving it!,1308528000,MovieTV

"The first thing I had to ask, from when I first got news of the tsunami, is only complete idiots and people too spoiled for life would travel from the U.S. or Europe to spend Christmas in a southeast Asian coastal tourist attraction.  Christmas is a holy time, with church, and home, and family, and even amid the celebrating and presents Christmas isn't Christmas without the sense of the sacred and the ties to home.This couple seem typical; plagued by financial worries they still take a plane to stay in a swank hotel, and the fact that they appear to be temporarily stranded in Japan for the father's work to begin with doesn't excuse it.The couple behave like complete idiots from minute 1.  It starts when it doesn't occur to either mother or son to stay in a tree once one catches ahold of one.  The father sends his five and six year old off to some unknown destination alone with people he doesn't even know; it's a wonder they weren't sold into prostitution or slavery like tens of thousands of children caught in that disaster.  He stays behind to look for his wife and eldest son who from what he knows are probably dead and certainly not both nearby and able to answer his shouts.The movie often drags.  It takes twenty minutes to even get going.  The end drags as well.  Parts of the middle drag.The ending is improbable.  I know for a fact that people characteristically looked for days or weeks for loved ones.  This family happen to come together and find each other by a pure series of accidents.  I don't think so!Finally, we are never told how the financially strapped upper middle class family manage to have a private plane fly them to civilization - and only the villagers who rescue the mother and the eldest son ever manage to think of putting clothing on them.  They are still barefoot when they get on the plane. Some of them are still covered with blood, despite days of wandering.  I mean, I'd have washed off, if I had to do it in a tidal pool.With all that said the movie does manage to hold your attention - much of the time.","08 25, 2013","Stupid, melodramatic and drags at times but entertaining",1377388800,MovieTV

"I bought this TV because I needed an upgrade from the 26-inch 720p Sanyo I had been using for close to 4 years. I wasn't looking for a Smart TV, I didn't need anything bigger than 60 or 70 inches at absolute maximum, I wanted something that was less bulky looking than my Sanyo, I wanted to upgrade to 1080p, I needed something I could use as a computer monitor, and I didn't want to pay more than about $800 or $900.I mostly use my TV for playing Xbox, using as a computer monitor (for gaming, graphic design, and regular computing), and then watching a little bit of Netflix and maybe a Movie here or there.I looked at some LCD Samsung TV's on here that were around 43 inches, and had it narrowed down between two. Two of my friends had TV's from the same model line, only smaller, and they looked fantastic. Two of my family members had LCD LG's of a similar size, which left something to be desired, but are certainly nice enough.However, when I finally decided on one of the Samsung TV's and finally decided to order it, I came on to find it out of stock. Navigating to my second choice, I came across this TV and my immediate thoughts were that there was clearly something wrong or else it was just too good to be true.Nope. This TV is just that much of a deal, mostly because not many people want Plasma anymore.The only complaint I have about this TV is that it has no analogue (Red/White) Audio Out ports on the back, which I miss, since I always hooked up a small PA I have to my other TV. Surprisingly, though, the speakers on this thing are pretty decent as far as HDTV speakers go. They aren't great in the big scheme of speakers, but they are some of the best stock TV speakers I've experienced, which was a pleasant surprise.The frame of the TV is very, very slim. Don't get me wrong, there are more sleek, skinny TV's available, but compared to similar priced sets of a similar size, this thing is amazingly thin. Don't think that equates to lightweight, though. This is definitely something you don't want to lift by yourself, although it's possible (I carried it up to my second floor apartment alone, but it was NOT fun).Now, for the important part. Like I said, I compared pictures with my old Sanyo, a few friends' Samsungs, a friend's 43-inch Sanyo, and the 40-something-inch LG sets that two of my family members have, but nothing can top how sharp, crisp, detailed, and rich the display of this TV is. It has shamed almost every other TV I've watched. It looked impressive out of the box, but after following the calibration advice from another review I read here on Amazon, the picture became close to unbeatable.After getting a 50-inch, slim set for about $700 with free shipping, I fully expected to find a slew of shortcomings when I spent some time with it, ending up with a fierce case of buyer's remorse, but that just didn't happen, and I don't see it happening.This TV is absolutely outstanding, and if you're looking for a big, slim, gorgeous TV and have no need for Smart TV features and are prepared to take the extra care of Plasma (you have to make sure the screen doesn't burn)then stop wasting your time and add this thing to your cart, because this is the TV for you.","04 13, 2013",Absolutely Fantastic TV,1365811200,Electronics

"I've owned Motorola modems for the last 10 years or so and each one has been great. I recently upgraded my internet speed to 50 mbps and signed up for Netflix streaming.  My cable company approves two Motorola combination modems for accessing their high speed service; I bought this one instead of the Motorola HBG6580 because several of the reviews on the 6580 mentioned that the wi-fi signal on it isn't that strong.  I have the modem connected by ethernet cable to my computer, and I have a tablet, two PS3s, and a printer connected through wi-fi.  All of these devices are getting the maximum wi-fi signal, variously described as 100%, excellent, and all 4 bars.  The farthest connection from the modem is the printer, which is in another room about 30 feet and 3 walls distant.  The modem has been connected for almost three weeks and there have been no hiccups at all.  I get an excellent HD picture and great sound with House of Cards through my PS3. So far, I'm not using any of the advanced functions, so I'm only giving it 4 stars, since I can't talk about those.

"Initial impressions:As with most of my New Trent items, the packaging is well done and eye catching. I liken it to Apple&#8217;s packaging.Pros/Positive impressions:- The internal hard case fits perfectly over the ipad. The plastic frame fit snugly around the unit and snaps into place with no play whatsoever.- The ports/camera/sensor cutouts in the hard case are well placed and accurate. There are no obstructions to any of the ports, switches, etc.- The silicon sleeve fits like a glove over the plastic case. It fits into a groove around the edge and creates a good seal to keep out dirt and moisture.- The port covers on the soft sleeve are accurate and fit perfectly into each opening. They're snug enough that they don&#8217;t pop out unnecessarily but are easily removed when accessing. Both the vol and home buttons are easy to operate.- The rotating hand strap and stand in back was a pleasant surprise. The strap makes &#8220;holding&#8221; the unit easy and convenient and the stand is set at a good viewing angle in both portrait and landscape mode.Issues/concerns:- The plastic covering the iPad screen was a little loose on my unit and tended to create &#8220;bubbles&#8221;. I was able to take most of it out by using a rubber squeegee used for installing smartphone screen protectors (a credit card would probably do the trick also). However, there&#8217;s enough space between the plastic and the iPad screen around the edges that the plastic is lifted off of the screen around the edges so there appears to be a &#8220;bubble&#8221; around the edge of the screen. It&#8217;s more noticeable when the unit is off, less so when looking straight on with the screen illuminated.Final impressions:- The case does add weight and bulk to the iPad mini, however no more so than any other ruggedized case. I feel it&#8217;s a good trade off for the protection it provides.I give this unit 4 out of 5 stars (although if I could I would have given 4.5 stars).

"Having owned the Galaxy S4 since it was released, I have already gone through a few cases.  Two of the ones I bought on Amazon were the:Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - White (SGP10204)Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10215)I can already tell you that I've vowed never to buy Spigen products ever again.  They don't last but a few months before they break.  But this isn't the place to talk about that (I've already done so via my individual reviews of each).  This review is about the YESOO Smart View case and how awesome it is.I originally wanted to have the real Samsung S-View case but it wasn't available at the time the phone was released.  However after seeing the official price tag, I knew it wasn't worth it. If I were to spend $30+ on a case, I might as well get an Otterbox (which I've also had problems with).  The YESOO is a BETTER case than the S-View at a fraction of the cost.  It's so cheap in fact, it's BETTER than any of the Spigen garbage cases I've tried.What I like about the case is that it takes advantage of the S-View screen.  Since the screen on the S4 is AMOLED and doesn't utilize a backlight to light up the entire screen, the ""window"" on the cover is the only part that lights up when the phone power button is pressed, when you receive a call, or when you receive any kind of notification (messaging) that turns the screen on temporarily.  In this window, you get to see the time, date as well as the notification bar.  Essentially, this saves you on your battery usage.  You can even answer calls via the ""window"" and you never have to open the flip cover open to talk!Protection-wise, I don't expect this to save my phone like say, an Otterbox would BUT I think the protection is enough that it is miles ahead of anything Spigen could make.  You see, the back of the case is a real hard shell (whether plastic or polycarbonate, not sure) but it's definitely more ""hardy"" & thick than the Spigen Slim Armor case.  Built into the case is the flip cover, which although slightly flimsy, is still rigid and maintains the shape and offers slight protection on any impact in the front.  The end of the flip cover has a magnet which ensures that the flip cover stays closed.  This is an AWESOME feature.  The regular Samsung S-View case doesn't have that and it can fly open at any time.I'm completely and utterly satisfied with this case.  It only cost me $9, almost half of any other case I've tried and it's cheap enough for me to buy another, if mine ever broke.  Very pleased with this case!!!","07 9, 2014","AWESOME, GREAT VALUE Case, Just Like S-View But Better",1404864000,CellPhone

"I bought this for a project I did for a friend's graduation present. I built a Wake 'N Bacon, which is a pig-shaped alarm clock that instead of playing a loud, horrible noise to wake you up, it turns on some heat lamps within and cooks the frozen slices of bacon you put in before you went to bed. That way you wake up to the smell of deliciousness. Genius, right?Well, I admit I got the idea from some college kids on the web, but I made it my own by installing a stereo on the side of the pig. Amp and alarm on one side, speakers and iPod dock on the other. Sounds great - he uses the stereo way more than the bacon-making feature. The remote is nice to have too, performing play/pause, skip and even volume control, though the Menu button doesn't do jack for an iPod.

"Among the available versions of the last two piano concertos (nos. 3 & 4)  by Sergei Rachmaninov, this one signed by Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes stands as an utterly valuable one, with some particular features that singles it out and makes it quite appealing. The technical approach of the soloist is impeccable, though somehow unusual. It seems to me not flamboyance-oriented, quite contrary. The proceedings are dominated by a reflective light, in contrast to other versions where the passion and the large scale developments govern. In musical terms, this approach could make much sense, if the preconceptions are abandoned. The pianist is paired by a top notch conductor (Antonio Pappano) and a super class orchestra (London Symphony), so the match between piano and the rich symphonic content of these concertos is marvelously realized.Maybe, some could prefer more ardent versions of these works (especially of the Third) such as those accomplished by Boris Berezovsky, Nikolai Lugansky or Denis Matsuev to name only a few recent releases by three truly stars of the Russian keyboard. However, Andsnes's version competes in its own right a place among the high level Rachmaninov recordings of the recent years.","07 28, 2012",Andsnes - valuable Rachmaninov accounts,1343433600,CDVinyl

"This really is a great alternative to those of us who do not have the floor room or wall space to support a large screen TV.This projector can enlarge movies up to 12x larger than a 40-inch screen (according to Epson). I haven't gone that big yet.If Epson was looking for a person with very little tech and computer skills to review this product, they could not have found a better person. Instead of telling you about all the wonderful technological advances it has, I'm going to tell you just how easy this product was to set up and to use.I was so amazed that the size of it reminded me of the size of my Father's old film projector from the 60's. I would have thought by now these things would have been much smaller! This may make the projector somewhat clumsy to take to meetings or to bring over to a friend's house.When I first saw the manual that came with it I almost fainted. It was an inch thick and I worried that I wouldn't be able to tackle setting up and using this without some expert help. But the Epson Company is very smart and is aware there are still people out there like me, they add a Quick Set Up sheet to the package that will get you on the road quickly and efficiently.Cables do not come with this product (since so many different types can be used ) be aware that unless you have some hanging around your house you will need (depending on what you are hooking it up to) HDMI, Video Cable, DVI or USB etc.Get real comfortable with your remote since it does just about all the work when using this projector.The first thing I did was to hook it up to my iPhone and had a slide show going on. The simple and easy to follow menu will be shown on whatever you are using for viewing. My pictures never looked better and you can control the size of the pictures depending on how big a screen you use. As for me I didn't use a screen since I have a flat painted, pale egg shell white wall that I used. You can easily adjust the colors to make up for any differences you get if you do not use a plain white wall. (or a screen, or a white sheet).The audio is a clear and crisp stereo that enhances  your  movies or when adding music to your slide shows.It is solidly built and seems to be able to withstand a lot.

There are two little plastic holders at the bottom and they stick out and won't stay in.

Yes I like mostly rock and metal, but I have a little bit of pop artists in my collection and Miley Cyrus happens to be one of them.Miley Cyrus, in my honest opinion has a good voice and I liked Hannah Montana's music. I like Miley's music more because it expresses her more. She's maturing and so is her music. I love this album and it fits right in with the rest of my cd's.The Music:1. Kicking and Screaming- I love this song! I believe this is my favorite of the album and it's only the 1st song! I wasn't expecting to hear this when I bought it. I was expecting pop-rock numbers but this, this is like full rock! I LOVE THIS SONG!2. Party in the U.S.A.- Not the best song, but catchy; You bet! I like this one more cause it's catchy, but overall, it's one of the lesser songs on the album. Still good tho.3. When I Look at You- Great ballad! This and the other ballad are amazing! This one's better, tho. It's just beautiful beyond belief (especially cause it's Miley Cyrus) and I just really like it.4. The Time of Our Lives- A nice catchy pop tune. I like this one, but not as much as a few others. I do think that this is better than Party in the U.S.A., tho.5. Talk is Cheap- This clashes with the rest of the songs; It's not nearly as good. It's not the use of the bad word in it, it's just not as catchy or meaningful as the previous songs (Mainly catchy cause only 2 of the previous songs are meaningful to me). It's just not as good.6. Obsessed- Very nice tune. I like this one a lot, too! The guitar solo on this is amazing! And Miley's voice is great.7. Before the Storm (Live)- This ruins the album. I wish it wasn't on here. I bought a Miley Cyrus CD. I don't wanna hear the god-awful voices of the Jonas Brothers on this! People love them, but in reality, they are just as untalented as Justin Bieber!Verdict: If you like Pop music, get it. If you like Miley Cyrus, get it! If your kid likes Miley Cyrus, DON'T get it!

"This version ONLY contains the director's cut.  Do yourself a favor and find the other Blu-ray release which contains BOTH the theatrical and director's cuts. (Don't be afraid of the European release. It's region free and the NTSC/PAL problem doesn't exist on Blu-ray) They are much different cuts.Personally, I prefer the theatrical cut because it has more of a sense of humor and a cleverness about it.  In comparison, the director's cut is not darker but is instead dulled and dour. The ending is anti-climactic without being any edgier than the theatrical version.  I also prefer the opening, the look and the score of the theatrical version.**The one bit I did enjoy from director's cut was a quick bit at 1:18:20-- which wouldn't fit into the theatrical version because at that point the plotline has diverged from the original.","05 30, 2012",Not the release version you want,1338336000,MovieTV
"Peace Keeper Wars is definately better than the ending of season 4, but is loaded with bad writing, production and directing.to start with, if Braca would take command away from Grayza for attempting to start a war in season 4, then Braca would have surely taken command away from Scorpius for starting the war then turning traitor.Then we have the whole bringing Criton and Aeryn back, no problem with that, what is reduculas is the baby was in Rygel, the baby was crystalized and was not brought back to human form with Criton and Aeryn, if the baby was brought back while in Rygel, then it could have been put back in Aeryn and brought back. There is no way to nurish a baby if it is in your stomach, so the baby growing in Rygel's stomach was impossible.  Not to mention the size of the device to transfer the baby.In the final battle, it is mentioned that all small arms be broken down and made into bombs and only heavy arms used (knowing the pulse pistols will not hurt Scarran) yet Criton keeps his and is killing Scarrans with it (this could not happen) and Aeryn kills War Minister Akhna with 1 shot from a pulse pistol.I purchased this and watched it 1 time, could not bring myself to watch is again.

"This is just a terrific adaptation of the 1986 graphic novel by Frank Miller. It may have taken 26 years for it to appear, but it was worth the wait. The animation, voice acting (Peter Weller is outstanding and so are the other voices), and faithfulness to the original concept are superb. Add to that a fine musical score and you have one of the best animated flicks of recent years. I think MIller would have been proud to see this adaptation of his work.

"Product quality was the same as it was for the previous set. The disc art is good as well as the art for this volume. Some fans may complain that Nel isnt in quite such a fanservice oriented angle as she is in the Japanese cover for this set, but her pose here is still nice and its colorful. The only major issues with the set, is that there is still no music on menus. I don't understand why each of the three discs lacks it, but it is quite odd considering the vast majority of the other Bleach dvd sets had it.Episodes and dub quality was great as usual. Velonica served as the opening theme for the entire duration while there were two ending themes. Hearing Aizen's voice was a pleasure as well as voices for Stark and older Nel. Only downside to the actual episodes is that two of the ending episodes here were filler.  The set did a great job in preparing us for set 14, the start to the Karakura subarc in this Arrancar saga as well as prepping us for one of the hottets fights in the anime, the eventual Ichigo v Ulquiorra.This set also contains the episode where Inoue essentially says Ichigo/Kurosaki-kun (in the subs) at least twenty times in one episode and nothing else!","06 21, 2012",With Filler Out The Way Bring In Aizen-Sama,1340236800,MovieTV

I previously had the same style case for my Galaxy S2 and loved it so naturally I found myself having to order one for my S4 as well as some other cases because for a phone this nice you just can't have enough choices for your protection.  It's a great case and doesn't add too much bulk.  It feels pretty good in the hand but ultimately it wasn't the case for me out of the ones I bought.  Very nice indeed though.  The case fits perfectly on the device and there's no wiggle room.  Everything aligns nicely as you can see.All the buttons were easy to use and had no issues at all with using them.  Quite possibly my only gripe would be that the Aegis on the S2 had more of a grippy feel on the back while the back on the S4 Aegis case was very slick.  I do think this case would look much better on the darker variants of the S4 as for me the white phone in this case just doesn't look good for me.  My preference is just that too because the case is made very well and if it holds up anything like the one on my S2 it'll last long beyond the time of upgrading to your next device.,"09 12, 2013",Great case but not for me this time.,1378944000,CellPhone

"First off Amazon.com has this as a 1:85 aspect ratio , which shows you can rarely trust their descriptions and be wary of reviewers who haven't watched this DVD/BR set or the extras.  The true aspect ratio is more like 2:76 (pretty extreme) and those complaining of the quality of the ""found"" footage on the roadshow version probably haven't seen the bonus feature describing the process and the true quality of much of it.. but I digress.As a boomer and even more, a child of Southern California , this movie not only took me on a 3 hour tour (I couldn't resist) of places I knew and had been with my family ,and some near our home,  but kept me laughing and enthralled and entertained without pause!  Several years back I took my girlfriend,now fiancee , to see it at a 70mm film festival in Los Angeles. If you are unaware , this is one of the few films Hollywood in their ongoing ineptitude to create anything new and continually re making films etc will NEVER attempt to duplicate ,nor could they. This film features so many legendary comedians and they all seem to be happy with their differing sizes of parts , from cameos to features.  I can't say that many of them were ever better in a major motion picture, before or after.  My mother , to her last days would still laugh until she cried thinking of Dick Shawn in his convertible crying ,  while yelling ""I'm coming momma""!  In fact Dick Shawn's immortal line ""Ya'll heard what Momma Said"" (momma was Ethel Merman) was used by none other than Jeff Beck as an introduction to a song a few CDs back.  Truly this film is ridiculously funny, epic, and a time capsule of amazing talents that were in many cases being phased out of the mainstream of the entertainment industry at that time in favor of the next generation of hopefuls. It seems everybody I know has a favorite bit from this film, from Jonathan Winters destruction of a small gas station, to Jim Backus as the drunk pilot with Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett, Phil Silvers is ridiculously funny and Jerry Lewis has a wonderful cameo, the GREAT Sid Caesar was never better in a feature film as well... and Jimmy Durante literally ""kicking the bucket"" starts it all off.... oh and Andrew Gold's father Ernest composed a wonderful merry go round of a film score!!!The existing DVD and Blu Ray were certainly appreciated , and the bonus features with extra scenes and the documentary with Director Kramer, welcome.  I was happy with them and grateful to have them.... but I did dream of more of the footage I missed and remembered. I should add that I've kept this edition because the outstanding documentary was not added to the Criterion list of extras and for a huge fan of the film it is an essential part of the films history for me. But again, speaking of extras they take up a WHOLE DVD in the 3 DVD side of the set they are so long and wonderful. The Press junket stuff from the day isn't 3-4 minute movietone news nothing they are over a half hour each and several of these as well as a reunion in 1974 and a more recent reunion hosted by Billy Crystal. The more recent one is a bit tough at times as there are a few wheelchairs on stage but it is balanced by the smiling and youthful faces from the heyday of the original release and I cherish this rare and wonderful footage , several hours of bonus features!For my money, I'm thrilled with this package, I love the dual format discs.... I have a DVD player in my office/workout area and a BR in my living room and I don't think everybody has BR yet, believe it or not.  I also love that Criterion looks for as many bonus features as they can find, and they have stuck in a tremendous batch of extras and enlighten and entertain.  Unlike others I LOVE the packaging.... goodness the fold out with the Jack Davis (again being a boomer who didn't know his work from MAD magazine) artwork spread across several panels!  The bonus sheet with the actual locations scenes were shot was particularly interesting to me as I knew most of them being a ""local"" but confirmation was cool and a few new spots surprised me.at under $30 , the amazon.com price, this is about the price of two tickets to a forgettable movie at your local mall..... and you have this immortal classic. I guess if you only have a casual interest the $10 version would be fine, but if you are a film buff this is the essential version.  Considering the fact that sales of physical product , music and DVDs, has been in free fall for some time I applaud and thank Criterion.  Those that nit pick and criticize should get their heads out of their behinds and do something themselves to find out how hard it is to get all the rights, releases, and research done as well as creating new features.  The major studios have given up putting work into ""legacy"" titles and in many cases are not only  NOT putting in extra features or even remastering , but often are issuing on DVDR  format.  Lets support Criterion and the other niche manufacturers that keep working on these valuable films.","01 23, 2014","Beyond expectations , from a grateful owner.",1390435200,MovieTV

Once I hooked the Seagate Backup Plus, it recognized it and Mac instantly turned it into a time machine. No formatting. No questions asked. Because my computer is new, there is not much to backup, so it was really quick.

With 3 TB on this drive, there is plenty of space for me to put lots of stuff on there. The device is solidly build with a rubbery grip. This version also comes with a power supply that attaches to it while the storage unit sits on top and makes for an all together pleasing presentation. The cable is not particularly long so its not something I have constantly attached to it. But once you plug it back in, the Mac reads it and does its job.Definitely a great device.

I thought it was a very good show there were a lot of great moment's to treasure and remember. However as i've been re-watching some re-run seasons of buffy i've come to realise that in the beginning of buffy the producers started off in the right direction by creating and establishing a dark world and a certain fear of the vampires in the first 2 seasons by that meaning that rules for vampires were in place: they burned in sunlight and were afraid of the cross etc but later as the seasons progressed from season 3 onwards it seems the rules went out the window meaning buffy was getting stronger, vampires were longer a threat, vampires didn't always burn in sunlight or could cast a reflection in the mirror etc, while i did enjoy the whole show it's made me realise that i prefare the first 2 seasons best but overall this dvd collection will be great have and watch with the family or own your own","04 30, 2013",Buffy: From Hemery To Sunnydale,1367280000,MovieTV

"First of all, I'm a leather case kinda gal when it comes to my bigger devices--ereaders, tablets, etc. The folios for this tablet are depressing. They don't mold well to the XOOM. The leather is cheap, and definitely don't hold the tablet securely. With that in mind I turned to the Zagg screen protector (love) and a snap-on case. This case is the best of silicone and hard plastic cases! You get shock protection without being a lint magnet. The hard plastic piece that snaps over the silicone is icing on the cake. I absolutely love the protection this case offers.  The volume buttons on the side are so much easier to manipulate with the case on than off. I have other cases and keep coming back to this one. I wonder what took me so long to convert! The case feels good in the hand and it makes the XOOM comfortable to hold. The hinge must have been redesigned because there is no flimsiness here. I ignored the review comments about the hinge because I hadn't planned on using it. I find myself using it quite often and don't see what all the complaints are about.The cut outs for port access are well designed. I like the bevel qdesign of the access points. It makes the large plug on my Bose headphones fit just fine without removing the case. I do have problems with this and my headphones on other devices, so kudos to Incipio for getting it right.The only gripe I have about the case is the protection points on the acrylic part. There's two pieces that come around the bottom of the case and only one on each corner. I think the XOOM would be even better protected if the ""clip"" part that wraps around had one on each side, and at least one--maybe two-- at the top. The top ones would be off center a bit bc of the location of the SD/sim card slot, but it would keep the silicone from moving off the XOOM so easily.I use this cover on a daily basis. I also use an HP 10.1 netbook sleeve to carry my cables and chargers, etc and the tablet in the case fits perfectly.

"When I first saw this on Creature Features on Channel 5 in NYC, I was instantly mesmerized. The monsters in this are, without a doubt, among the most unique ever put on film. But what makes this movie (are you paying attention The Asylum and Syfy channel?) is the earnestness with which the production company and cast brings this movie to life. We never see the monsters until near the end, but the sound effects used in bringing them to life, the crawling and slurping when they feed on their victims, is absolutely great. This is one of what I call the Marshall Thompson 50's trilogy of SF Films. He was also in It! The Terror From Beyond Space (great) and First Man Into Space (also tremendous!). They simply don't make films with heart like this today. The leads, Marshall Thompson as a USAF officer attempting to use atomic energy to increase radar so that the US and Canada can keep an eye on those nasty commies, is great. Kim Parker, who I never saw again, is excellent as the beautiful woman he becomes involved with and finally, Kynaston Reeves as the scientist whose experiment goes horribly wrong (don't they all?) is great as the reason behind the fiends. Finally we have the brought to life by stop motion animation, fiends. Literally brains with spines and antennae, they leap and crawl and murder humans for their brains, slurping them out like someone having an ice cream soda and wanting every drop.

"I bought the 50 ft version of this cable since I had to route it from my receiver (in a closet) to the woofer via an attic.  The routing of such a cable is not something I wanted to do more than once.  Therefore, I tested the cable first by just running it through my living room:  seemed to work just fine, but I didn't leave it there for more than 30 seconds before unplugging and getting busy fishing cable.  After getting it all set up, I noticed that the signal to my woofer was coming on only intermittently, after about 5 minutes of testing.  I adjusted the cable slightly, back on!  Another 5 minutes and off again.  Adjust cable, back on!  I also noticed that just small little movements of the cable and the connection would sputter easily.  I thought it was my receiver connection, but nope:  got that verified at my local service center, plus the receiver is brand new, as is the woofer.  After trying several different things to eliminate where the failure was happening, it turns out it was the cable!  I was very disappointed.  I'm simply returning to Amazon since its defective and will be buying another brand.  I have other Mediabridge cables that work just fine (HDMI), but I'm not taking another chance on having another one of these show up defective:  I have zero interest in fishing this thing more than......well, twice now.

"If you are not in any way familiar with motion comics, I am not sure what particular motion comic would be the best introduction for you, but this is not a bad way to begin. Like the writer of this series, Paul Jenkins, I had never heard of The Inhumans, but this really worked to my advantage, to learn of The Inhumans in this way. I think my father-in-law has perhaps mentioned The Inhumans, but his comic collection is so, AWESOME!, that because he has told me so much about Marvel & its history, this title would have been lost in the shuffle. Before I was injured, I was a freelance illustrator, primarily drawing & painting portraits. Until my father-in-law pulled out some of his comics, it had been over 20 years since I had looked at a comic book. I was depressed at how my gift was & is severely affected, yet he kind of brought me full circle with my art and its beginnings, and enjoying the art of others became strangely therapeutic for me, at least emotionally & mentally. I could never marry comic art with the realism of portraiture, so I was unexpectedly re~freshed from this, and it has been juvenescent for me. This is said to help you understand my particular perspective and why you should not be discouraged by what some other reviews have said. To be sure, motion comics ARE NOT traditional animations. These are works that are being created from artwork that was not originally intended for animation, so the look and feel is pausingly unseductive yet attractively unique, peculiar yet fascinating, all at the same time. Iron Man: Extremis was my introduction to motion comics, as I first discovered it on iTunes. It was not until the 3rd episode that I became aware that these were being made from comic books, and that element was intriguing. I immediately purchased the hardcover of Iron Man: Extremis, and I love it. But The Inhumans does not feel like Extremis, does not feel like Thor & Loki: Blood Brothers, does not feel like Spider~Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. But, you clearly recognize that just from the initial and continual movements of the motion comic, they do not possess the fluidity of the morning cartoons, and that is what is so appealing. The decision making to determine how to bring movement from the limbs, the mouth, voices, backgrounds, while preserving and not offending those who know the comics while still capturing a new audience with a different feel of the same comics; that is just astounding and has to be applauded. If you purchase the DVD for Iron Man: Extremis, the artist, Adi Granov, explains how he could never have envisioned how comic book art could be translated into this medium. However, even he was pleasantly surprised that it was crafted particularly well for animation despite the fact that the art originally lacked the purposed foundation & scope for this function. For The Inhumans, I decided to watch the bonus feature first, and it paid off. It provides much background on The Inhumans, and the social implications and how they are tied in make this even more inviting. So much thought is put in to making comics, and depending on what you have been exposed to, in terms of reading and history, comics often repeat or mimic many ideologies, mythologies or theologies, re~packaging them and presenting them in different ways. The Inhumans and motion comics are an extension of these considerations, so with that in mind, give this a try.

"Since I intensely dislike regietheater, for me there are only two options for Das Rheingold on DVD, this one and the first Levine Ring set.  Beggars can't be choosers. While the production values aren't perfect, I am reasonably pleased with this version and like it a little better than the Levine set.  The lip-synching doesn't bother me. Frankly, what I really hope for some day is a filmed version that really goes all out and has decent special effects.  On film, I would actually prefer good dramatic actors who lip-synch to music sung by the best singers one can find.  That way one gets to enjoy a believable dramatic production as well as fine singing.  Having said that, it is definitely true that this one is not bad, but still leaves a lot to be desired.  The staging is fairly static and the acting is middling.  However, for all its faults, I will still take this one over Gods on Gilligan's Island or Hooker Rhinemaidens or spacemen in the lab.  And the cast seems as balanced as on most DVDs I've seen.  Karajan and the Berlin PO are of course, terrific and the sound is pretty good for a mid 70s audio track.  Perhaps when people get tired of all the puerile directorial versions designed to &#34;shock&#34; the bourgeoisie and show off the superficial philosophical predilections of the latest designer du jour, someone will find a way to produce a filmed Ring with all the dramatic impact of a good HBO series with good looking actors backed by a fine orchestra and the best singers.

"Buyer beware this is not a real throat mic (layrngophone) it is an open air mic put in a bad location and with the sensitivity cranked to compensate. This is not a real throat mic as in what they use in the military.What is the difference? A real throat mic is actually a layrngophone and instead of using a microphone it uses a transducer coil to pick up vibrations inside your throat. This cheap piece of junk is just hearing your voice from your mouth. A real layrngophone would not pick up the sound from your tv or other things going on around you! This is why they use real throat mics in the military, because it doesn't pic up all the noise and gunfire. It makes costly noise cancelling technology less necisary, I say less because they can still pick up some background sound but not much so for battlefield use they are great. A helicopter may still need noise cancelling.Either way this is why when people complain about this it is because they had legitimately expected this to be a throat mic with the actual advantages of a real throat mic (tv would not heard through the mic audio) instead they got a less than par performance when compared to the normal mic that comes with the xbox as far as sound quality.Now that your mouth is further away from the mic it will pick up your tv at about the same volume as you.It is at least better than the mad catz but at least mad catz didn't call it a throat mic right out. Instead they used a round about term for it that made it so they where not lying!Well I guess technically this company can say well it is a microphone and it is on your throat therefore worthy of the name but everyone in the defense industry knows that a throat mic is the non scientific name for a layrngophone. In this situation it is unfortunate that throat mic became the norm since this company could never get away calling it a throat transducer or a layrngophone.For an example of a cheap but real pc throat mic see [...]You can buy an adapter to get it work with a Xbox but I just want you to see the difference in wording they use on a fake vs a real throat mic. It still may not perform as well as real military use throat mics but that's only because it doesn't have a strap to get enough pressure.You will see that the real one explains it does not transmit noise around you and only your voice! Where as this makes no claim to benefit you in any way it just let's your imagination fill in the gaps.Most people buying this are buying it because they believe that it is similar to what is actually used in war and maybe that is nice to give them the feel of engaging in combat but the reality is it is reducing the ability for them to clearly communicate with team members therefore reducing battle effectiveness.In other words if you purchase this item for anything more than a Halloween costume your are a fool and will be upsetting team mates.","09 4, 2012",Yet another FAKE throat mic.

"Bad Company 2 is my game. I play it on xbox and I play it religiously. I though these were kind of funny at first and purchased it as more of a joke to show some friends, but now I love them.By extending the stick height with FPS Freek there are two major bonuses as far as I can tell;1. A larger field to move the stick over.2. Easier movement of the stick. (allowing you to be more precise)Though the pack comes with two I only use one on the right stick. I increased BC2's sensitivity slightly more than what it would be for the relative increase in stick height, meaning I had to grasp an increase in sensitivity. The slight difference in ease of stick movement makes it easy to grasp. It took an hour or two of game play and some fiddling with the sensitivity but in the end it was worth it.I am a long time BC vet (PC 1942 to present console) so I was already doing pretty good. While an increase in precision has definitely helped, the noticeable difference for me has been in the close quarters firefights, ESPECIALLY when you find yourself passing someone on a corner or turning to shoot someone behind. The added sensitivity lets you turn exceptionally fast and as a result I am able to win a lot more of those occasional situations. It is almost comical when your opponent is slowly trying to face you while you are circle strafing him.Even if you only increase the sensitivity relative to the added height you still gain a bonus by getting some more play on the outsides.These aren't epic game changers, and they aren't a necessity to playing well, but the difference is noticeable and my kill/death ratio has improved as a result.","06 25, 2011",Gives an edge over non-users,1308960000,VideoGames

"Well,it took me a heck of a long time to get around to reviewing TCMs release of this Lon Chaney collection of films but it has finally arrived.This two disc set includes The Ace of Hearts(released Oct/21,running around 70 minutes),Laugh,Clown Laugh(released April/28 and running around 71 minutes),The Unknown(released June/27 and running around 50 minutes).Also included is Chaneys London After Midnight(released Dec/27),however being a lost film this is a recreation using stock MGM footage but mainly publicity stills.It gives one a rough idea of the films narrative.I first got onto Chaney way back when,when I was attending my silent film soirees and saw The Shock,He Who gets Slapped,The Unholy Three,The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Phantom of the Opera.There is no doubt Chaney was a master actor,never mind the makeup which was just the cherry on the cake.I have NEVER seen anyone on screen whose emotions jumped out at you and pulled you into his character like he could;he had no peers,period.The first film on tap is The Ace of Hearts,and although showing a bit too much old school melodrama at times,it has a fascinating plot which keeps you riveted from beginning to end.Chaney is a member of a secretive organization who seem to have a God complex.When they come across an entity who they believe is a menace or drag on society they take them out.To do this they draw cards and whoever gets the movies title card,that is who gets the ""honour"" of extinguishing that persons life.Lon and another member have a rival love for the only female member of the group.Lon loses out as the other man gets the ubiquitous honour of taking out someone they have deemed unacceptable.In fact both eventually marry,and Lon is torn up inside.The morning after the night before has weakened her resolve to go through with the murder by explosive,but not her new husband,who remains committed.Lon has camped outside their residence all night and confronts his rival in the morning,testing his resolve,as he leaves to do the deed.Lon returns to the group while the other goes on with his task.He is a waiter and when a younger couple who have eloped sit down at the next table he has a change of heart.He returns to the group with the news he didn't go through with the deed and HE is now #1 on the hit list.Chaney has promised his old flame he would help get the two out of their predicament,but the group will not be swayed.Chaney activates the bomb as they sit drawing cards and as ""kismet"" would have it,he draws the Ace of Hearts.There is an explosion and the couple who have fled are now free to live their lives without fear due to Chaney's sacrifice.This was Chaney on the rise as a star and he is basically just another player in an ensemble cast,but he sticks of the crowd as if he had a permanent spotlight on him constantly.Oh yes,this is a Goldwyn picture,before he joined Metro pictures.Few recall it was Goldwyn who originally had the lion at the beginning of his films.When he merged with Metro/Mayer he of course brought along his lion with him.No,I'm not lion.Laugh Clown,Laugh has Chaney as Tito the clown,later known as Flik.He has a traveling act with his brother,later known as Flak(one wonders if the ice skating European pair of Fric and Frak were inspired by this film?).They raise an orphan girl as their own,played later when grown by a 14 year old Loretta Young;called Simonetta.However Chaney has now fallen in love with her...yes,THAT way,and he becomes increasingly conflicted knowing it is wrong.He eventually seeks psychiatric help at the same time an Italian count seeks help for his affliction of uncontrollable laughter.The two decide they can help each other but the count has fallen for Simonetta also and becomes Chaney's rival,adding another dimension to his inner conflict.As the film progresses Simonetta finally realizes the real extent of Chaneys love for her.When she goes to tell the count their engagement is off Chaney's turmoil comes through once more and he decides there is only one way out for both of them.This film really showcases Chaney's acting to the nth degree and became one of his signature films and it is good to have it here in this collection.At one point his brother is urging Chaney to ""laugh,clown laugh...laugh,though your heart is aching"".Now for those in the know,the latter is a line,word for word, from Chaplin's song Smile,written in 1936 for his film Modern Times.Hmmm.The Unknown stars Chaney as an ""armless"" knife thrower in a circus act.Trouble is he is NOT armless and he is using the circus as a front for his nefarious activities in different towns the circus travels to.He is in love with a young Joan Crawford who hates being pawed by men.Chaney's rival for her affections is the strong man who slowly but surely brings her around.In the meantime Chaney resorts to extreme measures to win her love forever.He decides to have his arms really removed by a surgeon that he blackmails.After the deed is done he returns to the circus to find that his love has finally settled on the strongman and both are to be wed.The couple show Chaney their new act which involves the strongman restraining two horses on either side of him,both on treadmills.If one of them or both were to stop his arms would be ripped out.This is Chaney's chance and as the treadmills slow down Crawford sees what Chaney has done and jumps down in front of one of the horses to stop it rearing up.Chaney pushes her aside and dies under the horses hooves.The most famous scene in this film is the moment Chaney has returned to the circus after his arms have been amputated and realizes his love is marrying someone else.The range of emotion that Chaney exudes is unparallelled.This scene lives up to its hype and beyond.When Gloria Swanson tells William Holden in Sunset Boulevard""...we had faces then"",you better believe it as you watch this scene.Technically speaking the films have been remastered to their best and generally are clear and crisp.All of them have age related problems,and are mostly incomplete,but they are the best we have as of this writing,which over all is more than acceptable.Extras include two featurettes on the music scoring candidates for two of the films,commentary on the films,opening commentary by TCMs Robert Osbourne and a beautiful 85 min.documentary by silent film expert Kevin Brownlow on Chaney that you won't want to miss at all.It features many rare clips of his films and is a great primer for those just learning about the master craftsman.All in all this is a must own set of Chaney films for all of his fans and those of the silent era in general.All of the films,though mostly truncated,are mighty nice to look at and a testament to the man of a thousand faces and his peerless acting ability.They do NOT make 'em like Chaney anymore...and we are the poorer for it.","05 20, 2012",Three must owns of a master craftsman of the Silent

"'Infamous 2' is the best video game I've played all year. It's a sequel that takes the strengths of the original game, polishes off the rough areas and injects a heavy dose of color and personality. The gameplay's more exciting, the setting is more appealing, and not since 'God of War' has there been a game that makes you feel like a super-powered badass!'Infamous 2' puts you in the role of series protagonist Cole MacGrath, a person with electric superpowers who's done great good or evil (depending on how you play) for his home town of Empire City. After losing a battle with a super being known only as 'the Beast', Empire City is destroyed and Cole and his allies flee to New Marais (think New Orleans) to upgrade. The story is pretty straight-forward comic book fare with Cole getting involved in the conflicts of New Marais while powering up for his rematch with the Beast. The comic-style cutscenes from 'Infamous 1' are back and sharper than ever, but the real joy is the improved in-game cutscenes which seem movie-quality thanks to the engaging main characters. The cutscenes and story do change a little in 'Infamous 2' depending on whether you're a hero or villain but it's mostly towards the end of the game. The story DOES assume you've played 'Infamous 1' so interested gamers will want to start with the original game first.The graphics in 'Infamous 2' (with a few exceptions) are excellent. While the actual graphics are a little more detailed in texture than in 'Infamous 1', the improved motion-capture makes Cole and other characters move naturally giving them an organic look. The setting of New Marais is also a big improvement over Empire City as each location looks fresh and varied with excellent use of color and details to make the town come alive. It's no Liberty City (and is a bit smaller than Empire City) but it suits 'Infamous 2's comic book world perfectly!The audio in 'Infamous 2' is also a treat with more Bluegrass-inspired tunes to compliment the New Orleans-themed setting. The voice-work is top-notch with new voice and mo-cap actor Eric Laden (of 'Left 4 Dead 2' fame) making the character of Cole his own! Nika Futterman is also a standout as the fire-powered 'Nix'.While 'Infamous 2' is aesthetically an improvement over 'Infamous 1' the basic gameplay is very much the same. You're still running/jumping/climbing/flying across buildings and covering and shooting with your powers. The side quests are much more varied than 'Infamous 1' but still not that complicated. The dead-drops (which I all but ignored in the original game) are now essential if you want to flesh out more of Infamous 2's story and characters. There are some racing-type missions (or 'overload' missions) on rooftops but they take a back seat to more super-powered battles in the streets. I personally liked this change as battling against other super-powered beings was my favorite part of Infamous 1 but some gamers might be put off with a more 'shooter'-minded approach. Also, the camera does get stuck sometimes (especially during the melee attacks) and while I never died as a result it did become a hassle.The major gameplay change in 'Infamous 2' is your powers. You still need EXP to upgrade abilities (which get unlocked as the story goes), but to actually obtain a power you have to pull off certain stunts and moves with your current abilities. This makes the game much more involved in my opinion in that it makes you experiment with each power before upgrading. There's also a LOT more powers to obtain in 'Infamous 2', so much so that you have to go into your menu and assign different upgrades to different buttons. The Good/Evil powers are much more varied as 'Good' powers focus on precision and 'Evil' powers focus on destruction. For that reason alone the game is worth playing through twice!While 'Infamous 2' won't impress detractors of the first game, it does just enough different and does it with more excitement and thrills that it'll easily entertain series fans! I want to stress that you DO want to complete the first 'Infamous' before diving into this sequel as certain story-elements may not make sense ( and hey, Infamous 1 is still a great game...which will hopefully make one kick-ass holiday bundle!!). Fans of Infamous 1 and empowering sandbox games, this is a must buy!","06 9, 2011",Cole with personality?,1307577600,VideoGames
"Over the years, I've actually had three versions of the Flip HD camera through the last couple of years and so I guess I'd have to recommend it as a nice and compact starter camera.I'm going to be relatively brief in this synopsis as it looks like the technical pros and cons of this particular unit have been debated extensively. I have used several miniature camcorder devices (in addition to the Flip)in the past with varying degrees of success.  You can't always expect perfection from the smaller models. To me, it often comes down to a combination of pricing versus convenience versus clarity. How these elements balance out (and how important they are to you in the first place) tend to be the deciding factor in whether a particular camera does the job.I've come back to the Flip HD several times due to a number of reasons including easy and intuitive interface with my computer and good solid images.  I will be honest, though, the Flip HD does not have the greatest longevity for frequent usage.  If you want something to last years, I recommend you pay more money and shop a sturdier product.  This is neither the best or worst product, it is about what you would expect (if not slightly better) for the competitive price point.  For casual usage and with care, though, this should meet the requirements of the casual user.  4 stars for function, I'll deduct a star for longevity.

"As far as trashy, offbeat, unintentionally funny B-movies go, few can top DOG EAT DOG (1964) in overall bizzareness and manage to be as entertaining. Five stars isn't overrating it, trust me.Jayne Mansfield heads a cast that includes Cameron Mitchell, Ivor Salter, Isa Miranda, Werner Peters, Aldo Camarida and Dody Heath in a fast-paced yarn about a $1 million cash heist and everyone's greed to possess it. As Jayne says, ""I got a pash for the cash!""Directed by Ray Nazarro (Asst. Director on 1936's REEFER MADNESS), Richard Cunha and Gustav Gavrin, and shot on location along the beautiful Adriatic and Mediterranean coastlines, and an island villa, DOG EAT DOG mixes intrigue and ripe performances in a way that maintains interest throughout. Often times the dubbed dialog is over the top - but that's to its credit - after all this is a CULT film, and we love cult films for their unabashed outrageousness. Mitchell's violently desperate search for the money is one of the film's highlights that has to be seen to be believed.Darksky Films' DVD of DOG EAT DOG is of pristine quality; the lush, creamy black and white cinematography is a pleasure to indulge yourself in, as are the charms of Miss Mansfield - she's pretty hot in this. The film is formatted to its correct 1.85:1 aspect ratio and is letterboxed.The extras include newsreel footage of Jayne Mansfield, a photo gallery and the theatrical trailer.Jayne Mansfield and cult film aficionados will definitely want to pick this one up.

"The Sony MDR-1R are a pleasure to wear and to listen through. They're wonderful for rock, jazz, classical, metal and even tv watching. At MSRP they feel over-priced and are overpriced compared to the competition from Yamaha and Sennheiser but at the price I've usually seen them at from Amazon they are a solid value. Each pair of headphones I've owned has had it's own signature sound. I find the Sony's to be fairly neutral and well-balanced. So great overall headphones.Things I liked- They have a slim and low profile design with extremely comfortable ear cushions and a headband that's well-padded and exerts just the right amount of pressure.- There are lots of thoughtful little touches. For example, the right side is marked with an (R) on the inside of the right earpiece. Just where you are likely to be looking when you come to put them on.- The cables are detachable and replaceable and two cables are included. One with an inline mic and remote and one without. In my experience the cables are the first thing to go and it'll be easy to replace them. The cables are also reasonable (or perfectly sized) for my needs. No long cables to trip over.- They earpieces rotate to reduce the bulk of the headphones and make them easier to store- They have great frequency response and are well-balanced. Tight solid base, expansive mid-range, and clear highs. No distortion at all through multiple sources- They're extremely responsive and sensitive and even an iPhone 5 was able to drive them at any volume I desired. By comparison my Sennheiser HD580 and my Shure SE535 both needed the volume increased to get the same responseOne little complaint:- Although they look really cool, are comfortable, and sound great some of the materials do feel cheap. The overall feel is a step below Sennheiser's in that price range","06 19, 2013","Comfortable, lightweight, balanced & sensitive",1371600000,Electronics

"I ordered the most recent reissue of the album on the Sony Legacy label (SKU078636764122) and was immediately disappointed!  After the opening song (""Aspenglow"") plays, the first three seconds of the second song start to play before the track indicator changes.  In other words, if you decide to skip ahead to track #6 (""Christmas For Cowboys""), you'll miss the first three seconds of the song.  This is because those three seconds appear at the end of track #5.This appears to be a disc mastering error.  I tried playing this CD in several players - with the same result.  I don't know if this problem has been observed in previous CD releases of this album.  I downloaded the album from iTunes, and it plays perfectly.","12 9, 2011",Sony Legacy CD reissue does not play properly,1323388800,CDVinyl

"The D-Link MovieNite Plus is easy to set up. For audio/video outputs it has a small jack into which you can plug in an included cable, but this gives you standard-definition composite video and analog audio, eliminating the benefit of the high-def video and digital audio output.  To get the good stuff you need an HDMI cable, NOT included.  Connect this to your TV or, better, audio/video receiver, and connect the small power supply. The MovieNite Plus has an Ethernet jack but also includes a built-in WiFi adapter and the latter is what I used.I powered it up and it found my home WiFi network. It supports Wireless N but only at 2.4GHz, not 5GHz. I prefer the latter for something like video streaming as it is ""less crowded"", but the 2.4GHz works.  I like that it supported WiFi Protected Setup where I just push a button on my router and the two devices exchange information - no manual entry of passwords.  If you can't use WPS, you can enter the info manually.  One thing I discovered later is that the default configuration is stereo only.  If you are using HDMI and the device you connect to supports Dolby Digital, you have to go into the Preferences (small gear icon on the upper right of the main screen) and select Passthrough for audio. I got no surround sound until I did that.The main services you can get at are Netflix, Vudu, YouTube and Pandora - there are dedicated buttons for these services on the small but well-laid-out remote. I tried Vudu and YouTube - both services loaded quickly and the remote was responsive as it navigated the user interface.  I had not used Vudu before, and the interface was attractive. Entering my username and password was a bit painful via the ""Ouija-board"" interface, but at least I have to do it only once per service. Vudu had me run a network speed test when I asked for a ""HDX"" high-def video, and it passed with flying colors.I tried a variety of videos and they all displayed crisply in high-def where that was the format, and even the standard-def offerings looked quite good on my 60"" set. Even the YouTube videos looked good.  The sound of the various programs I played seemed a bit underwhelming, even the demo of Dolby Digital Plus, but perhaps I needed to crank the volume even higher. I did get good surround sound from the rear speakers.There are also a bunch of ""apps"", mainly short videos from various web sites.  Some of these played fine, some gave me ""network errors"".  If you have a D-Link IP camera, you can use the MovieNite Plus to monitor it through the ""MyDLink"" service.This being an Amazon review, I have to wonder at the absence of Amazon Instant Video.  Perhaps it will come in an update.  This was my first experience with a dedicated streaming video box and I can't find much fault with it. You are left to puzzle out the meaning of some of the remote buttons on your own - there is no user manual other than a brief getting-started leaflet that helps you hook it up. The D-Link web site doesn't have a manual for download when I looked today.October 23, 2012I see that there is now a full manual at D-Link's web site.

"Elliott Carter and Edgard Var&egrave;se can be seen to represent two distinct extremes in the universe of American music.Carter is a composer whose considerable originality is almost always obscured by his almost obsessive insistence never to do the obvious or straightforward thing. As a result of Carter's notion of modernism and his insistence always to be ""modern"" in certain narrow ways, his music often sounds a lot like the music of much less interesting and original composers.What this means is that if you are going to get what Carter has to give you, you're likely to have to slog your way through some disappointments. For me, the disappointments were not that the music was too modern or too dissonant or too disjoint. Rather, it was that I was expecting Carter's originality to be more immediately audible.The things about Carter's music that are unique are very subtle. He changes rhythmic pulse in very original ways. He plots the flow of his music according to notions that are unique to him.Boulez is up to this music. This is saying a lot. If you are willing to listen to a music that is dense, complex, and utterly without cheap attractiveness, give this a try.Edgard Var&egrave;se is in many ways Carter's opposite, particularly for those of us who are not professional musicians. Earlier than Carter's music, Var&egrave;se's almost always sounds as unique as it is. Hyperprism is typical of the composer's works for small ensemble. Var&egrave;se chose to leave out melody and counterpoint and focus on rhythm and instrumentation. He eschewed melody by having none. With no melodies, there can hardly be counterpoint. One of his ways of de-emphasizing melody is to occupy extremes of dissonance at all times. No flowing back and forth from the consonant to the dissonant for him! It's always maximally dissonant.Listening to Var&egrave;se's music in 2012 is misleading in a way, for it has influenced the music that came after it. It is hard to imagine how original it was when it was created. Ecuatorial and Deserts are late works, Deserts with a little bit of electonic music thrown in.Boulez loves this sort of hyper-dense, hypermodern, hyper-difficult music. If you think you might like it as well, this is a very good place to begin.","05 5, 2012",Two very different composers,1336176000,CDVinyl

"Purchased this locally.This laptop has been been fine for processor, display, OS.  It is lightweight and has good battery life.The problem has been a mechanical keyboard failure and poor customer service.This unit was purchased February 1, for a college student. ""Plus"" key popped off mid-March; retainer bracket beneath was broken. I tried for weeks to get ASUS to discuss repair options. Didn't want to put unit out of service for the entire month before final exams, but I couldn't even get someone to ANSWER me.  Of note is that ASUS will not provide a replacement key bracket or keyboard to the consumer.Update:  The best that ASUS would offer was to have us ship the unit back to them (we are on east coast, must ship to California).  Finally dawned on me to pop a key off my Toshiba laptop and look at the bracket beneath.  It was a match!  I'd previously tried to order a replacement bracket from a 3rd-party vendor ($4-6), but could not match.  Now I knew to order the part using my Toshiba model number.  Success!  The plus key is back in place.I remain disappointed in the service that the manufacturer offered, and it would make me think twice about shopping this brand again.  However, with our persistent effort to repair it ourselves, we once again have an intact laptop that functions appropriately for its intended use.  I've upgraded to a 3-star rating because the unit seems to operate smoothly.  However, I believe that an early mechanical problem and failure to communicate regarding service are critical enough to cost a couple of stars; you may disagree.If you are seeking information on this unit, you may also want to look for ""k54c,"" as that appears to refer to the same model.  Might be useful if you end up trying to shop parts for it.","04 7, 2012",ASUS x54C laptop,1333756800,Electronics

"I bought this to control my guitar amplifier, guitar effects, and the rests of my musical gear that's connected to it. I now have total control of what needs to be 'on' and what not, thanks to the individual power switches. Before that, I was using one of those regular cheap-white $7 surge that either turns everything on or off, so I had to unplug certain devices, except for the guitar amp because it has an on/off power button. My effects processor does not have a power on/off switch so I'd have to manually plug it in every time I play, and unplug it when I stop. Now I have EVERYTHING plugged in to the Ultra and powered individually; and also with the 'main' master power button -- one flick for ON or OFF! Convenience as hell if you'd asked me.Aside from the conveniences, I am glad that the Ultra surge protector was able to cut off power individually for unused devices to conserve energy. The plugs are spaced apart just enough to accompany bigger transformer adapters and still manages to provide adequate space for adjacent AC plugs -- so long as you don't have TWO big block transformers back to back you are fine. In addition to the six individually powered outlets, there is a seventh 'unswitched' or Always ON outlet -- which I use for my electronic LED alarm clock radio, so when the surge is off, I'd still have the clock running!There's also some 'rack-mountable' professional units out there that are similar but selling for hundreds more (like the Fuhrman), but at this price the Ultra is exactly what I was looking for, and it did the job!","07 29, 2011",A simple solution for saving energy.,1311897600,Electronics

"It has much thinner legs then it seems, and it's pretty wobbly fully extended. If you hang out near the ground for say landscape photos, or portraits on the ground or benches then this would work okay. If you were on top of a hill and wanted to get it tall enough to get over that bush in front of you and it's really windy this may not be the best choice. Yes it does have a hook on the bottom and that great. But hanging your backpack from that on a windy day will make it a nice pendulum.If you pull the center column up and tighten it it will push the bar a little in the opposite direction so you will have to compensate for that a little with the ball head to make it level. Some of the legs are really tight and take a little effort to get slide out and i like that. Some of the legs just whip right out on you. You can get this thing into some pretty crazy shapes with the legs moving to low to the ground. I even leaned two legs out and use the almost 90 degrees and propped it against a wall. So the are very versatile.I do like the ball head and the base plate system. The extra plate lock will help your camera from falling off if you forget to lock it down. Even after loosening it from the head, you have to push a button to slide the plate out so it won't fall off the head unless the circumstances are just right and that would be pretty unlikely.It comes with a nice back to carry it, and it is light. But that is obviously due to the thin legs and aluminum. That being said it can be pretty sturdy when you keep it low and keep the center column really low. The only thing I did wish came with was another tube for the center column that was much shorter. One of the pictures shows a really low shot and that can not be done with the 60"" model. At least not that I have figured out. I will keep looking at update this if I do find a way.For the price, it's worth it for a quick, light, walk around but would want a thicker leg tripod if you want to use the full 60"" Unless your using s point and shoot, then this would probably work just fine for anything you need.","10 19, 2012",It's a good travel tripod,1350604800,Electronics

You don't get major driving bass or pure clarity with music like you would with a high-end music headphone like Bose, Skull Candy or Beats but they are just as good as my Sony headphones. Voices, background sounds and subtle music in TV and movies sound great with these.  The only minor complaint I have about these headphones are the comfort.  After wearing them for a long movie (say around 3 hours) they start to become quite uncomfortable to my ears. They need better ear pads. Plus they are really bulky and heavy. If they could find a way to make these about half the size and weight, they would be absolutely perfect. Even with the size and comfort issues, you will not be disappointed with these headphones. They get great reception, even when I am in the next room or even outside on the deck. My wife loves to use them while doing laundry or cleaning, walking from room to room in the house, and never has an issue with reception.","11 15, 2012",Best Wireless Headphones for the price!,1352937600,Electronics

I'm buying a Kindle Paperwhite and this is a 19.99 add-on.  Also it should be noted that this power adapter does not come with a cable.  Other reviewers have given it a 1 star rating because of this & I do agree because it is overpriced.  Barring that this adapter works great.I am writing this review because I found a cnet review that clarified that you don't get a power adapter but you do get a cable with your new Kindle Paperawhite.  Below I've pasted the link to the cnet review and below that a portion of the review that relates to this power adapter.[...]... ""It's also worth mentioning that while Amazon sells an AC adapter separately, the Paperwhite doesn't come with one, just a Micro-USB cable for charging. That means you'll have charge the Kindle via your computer or use a wall-plug adapter from a device you already own.

"Allen Stone is the real deal. A true musician and artist who knows his craft. He is obviously strongly influenced by the early masters of soul, funk and R&B.; His pitch is spot on which is refreshing to me as a singer who is often disappointed at the younger pop singers who try to do vocal acrobatics without first mastering the basics of pitch and tempo. Allen has spent years earning his chops in hard work and live performances. I caught him on Live From Daryl's House and fell in love with his voice. He can work a phrase and emote without resorting to endless vocal runs. If I had not seen him performing, I don't think I would have matched his almost hippie-nerd quirky appearance to his soulful voice. He is young and still has room to grow which no doubt he will as he continues to make music.On this album, my favorites are ""Unaware"" which is a slower love gone wrong song that could have been done by one of the greats at Motown back in the day. I had it playing on a loop with a very short playlist for days just savoring the vocals like a fine glass of wine. I also enjoyed ""Celebrate Tonight"" which is a happy, up tempo song that made it onto my favorite workout playlist. It makes me smile every time I hear it. The entire album is a good listen for me as someone who enjoys things like old Motown, 70s funk and anything with a great beat for car dancing on long trips or during the crazy commute.","06 15, 2013",Wow for this young blue eyed soul genius,1371254400,CDVinyl

"No, it doesn't have that original, fresh charm that Super Mario World had, nor does it have any unique differences from its predecessors like SMB 2 or 3 did. But honestly, does it really matter at a certain point? I have enjoyed the Mario series since I first played Super Mario World, and I've learned that I don't feel the need to judge these games based on originality anymore. The levels are new, the feel of the game is new, and I believe it is a vast improvement over New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Unlike that game, this game is a lot of fun single player, and like all multiplayer Mario games, it's extremely fun to play with friends. So who cares that it doesn't have some fresh charm that the originals did? In a series like this, I don't want Nintendo to try new things. I want Nintendo to stay ""safe"", but still improve graphically.Graphics: 10/10 Period, it's the best graphics of any Mario game ever, and the first to have HD. For a casual game, the graphics are extremely sharp, and it just feels wonderful playing this game.Story: 5/10 The story isn't good, but in a Mario game, is it ever? That's not the point of a Mario game, so though it's a low score, it's not a stab at the game.Gameplay: 9/10 The controls feel smooth, the only problem I have is that it's not compatible with the Pro Controller. It probably would've been my controller of choice, so I'm disappointed they aren't compatible.Overall, this game feels somewhat like a DLC for the Mario series: new, better levels, that aren't that different, but are still worth your money. Don't expect something radically different from its predecessors, just expect a good, old-fashioned, outstanding Mario game.","06 4, 2013","Unoriginal, Casual Fun",1370304000,VideoGames

"This case became an upgrade of my 9-year old Antec full-tower plastic case. The first impression of this case after opening is its huge and spacey. If you live in a dorm or lack space, this should not be your choice. It is quite tall and fills up the space nicely. Installing the power supply and the mobo were a breeze. Make sure all your screws are lined up properly and you align your mobo's back plate.My major hassle was the bottom supposedly 3.5"" drive container section. In the online videos and instructions, no one really installs anything on these bays since there are four SATA drive bays already available. Since I knew I was going to fill up those drives with large spindle HD drives, I wanted to use the bottom bay. For that I used a 256-GB Kingston SSD. After using a 3.5"" bay extensions which usually ship with SSD's, I was shocked to see that there was at least a quarter inch gap between the screw holders. Also the holes did not align properly either. Least to say, I was very appalled and verified all the screws and add-ons came with the box, there was nothing that would make it fit. So there comes the cordless drill.From the rear of the holes, I widened it just enough that I could attach a screw to the SSD's case and screw it in. After 5 minutes of try-err, I made it to work. On the other side though, I have that quarter inch gap. I picked up one of the screws which came with the box and screwed it on the matching hole. With three holes, it seemed stable enough and I was lazy. Plus it is and SSD, and it is not going anywhere. Except when it fails. So make sure you have your back ups.Anyway, the unit comes with three 140mm fans and they are very quiet. This is a huge upgrade from my old system, but that used two rather loud 80mm fans. Love it! The quality of construction on this case is very nice. Aluminum and steel is awesome. Cable management is simply awesome. I am not as of wrapping every cable, but the cables coming out from the front panel are labeled properly and found their matches on the motherboard without any problem or require using a digital IO meter.The white LED on the front panel is a little bright for my taste, but I don't mind it too much yet. The large HD's can be installed on the 4-bays and I really like their cable management, and it only requires one power connection for the four drives. Very nice feature. If you have time, watch a few of the videos on line about this case, and make your own decision.Like I said, the only problem I had was the SSD installation at the bottom bays. If Corsair guys know a way of doing that and what I may have potentially missed, please let me know. I hope to enjoy this case for the next 10+ years.","09 17, 2012",XL-Full Tower case with lots of options,1347840000,Electronics

"These speakers do an excellent job if you don't have a room that's amenable to a full 5.1 or 6.1 surround setup. Here's what I like and don't like about this setup:Pros:- With just these 2 speakers, you alleviate the need for both the various speaker pairs and the surround capable receiver.- Small footprint. If your viewing area real estate is at a premium, these are worth consideration.- Great sound. The sound quality of just these 2 speakers is excellent. They mimic surround capability very well.- Multiple input sources. You can hook these up to 3 input sources. I have mine hooked up to the TV, Satellite box, and DVD player.- Active power. If you don't want to use the speakers you can just turn them off with the included remote control.- Unobtrusive. The cables into the main speaker hide pretty well behind the equipment. The subwoofer is wireless so can be placed just about anywhere you want.- Easy setup. The speakers come with a pair of receiving headphones. You put them on and move to 5 different locations within your viewing area. The speaker setuptalks you through the process as it calibrates based on each location you move to. It worked perfectly the first time.Cons:- Expensive! For the price of these speakers you could get a very good surround setup (Surround receiver, 2 front speakers, 2 satellite speakers, 1 Center channel speaker,1 subwoofer). If I were spending my own money, I would go with the full setup.- Connections. The speakers connections use coax audio cable (2) and RCA cable (1). It also had Optical digital cable connections (2) but my input devices didn't supportthis or I would have used these as I believe they're the best option for high quality sound connections.Overall I'm very happy with the speakers with the cost keeping them from being a 5 star product. With the 3 inputs I'm able to use the speakers for watching regular TV (via DirecTV) or watching a DVD. They're really good for listening to music channels and for movies. A good option if you're unable to install a full blown surround systembut not great due to the high cost.","03 1, 2012","Excellent, but expensive, speakers",1330560000,Electronics
"It could be a 5 star product, but some lazy design flaws and what must be a lack of real world testing makes it a flop.The way the Apple trackpad is designed means that you can't click on the pad while holding it off the surface.  So you if you want a solution that makes you keyboard/trackpad portable/handheld, this isn't it.The little i-beam and rubber cap are not well designed.  The cap looks out of place, and the i-beam joint pushes down on the track pad if you use keys on the right of the keyboard, deal breaker.Cool idea, bad implementation.  It's a shame all the popular blog sites rave about this piece, but don't bother to give you the full story.  I love my PlugBug, but the Magicwand is not up to TwelveSouth standard.
